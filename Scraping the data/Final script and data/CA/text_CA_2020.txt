One of the best #SuperBowl traditions is to follow @BaldBryan as he brings to light all the "too cool for school" kids who use the term #sportsball today as though they're being funny.
Its Superbowl day. As a Seahawks fan, I really can't(shouldn't)cheer for the Niners. And I dated a guy from Missouri who was a Chiefs fan, that was THE MOST fuqed up relationship/breakup, so that makes me not want to have any "like" for the Chiefs.
Maybe a movie day instead!?

It's #SuperBowl Sunday, but it's also a significant day on the #CFL calendar: The start of the first-ever, week-long negotiation window ahead of Free Agency. @FarhanLaljiTSN and I breakdown this new wrinkle in the CFL calendar @CFLonTSN https://t.co/I7FD58gxWG
Looking at my onscreen @rogerstv channel guide and shocked to see that while @TSN_Sports carried today‚Äôs #Raptors game in 4K, it‚Äôs not carrying anything on its 4K feeds this evening. So no Super Bowl in 4K?

Don‚Äôt care who wins the #SuperBowl because it‚Äôs not Buffalo. Excited to watch the commercials because I actually have US channels this year üëåüèªüëçüèª
Made a poll in the hockey group chat of who should win #SuperBowl and Bernie Sanders is running away with it
Will @CTV have Canadian or American commercials for the #SuperBowl today?

@Chest_Rockwell7 A Super Bowl will never be played were the weather can influence a championship game..... kinda like hockey. 

The CFL wants to keep our game, our game. I feel the same way. And we are very small potatoes too.

GOP Senators and the NFL - cut from the same cloth, and running the same plays. It‚Äôs disgusting and dangerous, and they will both continue to do it as long as the public lets them.

It‚Äôs been 3 years since I watched or supported the NFL in any way.

Kyle Shanahan and blowing double digit leads in the #SuperBowl name a more iconic duo.

So, for those enjoying the SuperBowl you should probably pay attention to what the @Chiefs fandom says to Indigenous folx.

Attended a Super Bowl watch party yesterday. 

Out of 7 people including me, the average age was 30

4/7 were commercial bankers 

2/7 were teachers, one in school to become a teacher. 

The only people in their 20s were me(23) and a younger gent(20). #SuperBowlLIV
No lie I was waiting for Ja Rule to come out during the super bowl performance.
Shout out @49ers
Y'all did what you could
#GoodGame #SuperBowl
Things that I learned last night during the game: 

- Jimmy G a fraud.
- Kyle Shanahan is a choker in the 4th.
- Undrafted RB‚Äôs were the stars of the Super Bowl.

@Text88022 @America1stTiger @usairforce @USNavy @USMC @USArmy @USCG There sure was a lot of patriotism shown at the Super Bowl. ü§î It‚Äôs almost like they are trying to win back some fans.
 
Maybe the next time one of their employees disrespects the flag they‚Äôll tell him to express his 1A on his own time. At an actual police station maybe üòè
@PrimeLindsay @BannedScene Only 2 Super Bowl losers became Super Bowl winners the next year. 

Only 5 Super Bowl losers got back to the Super Bowl and lost again (3 of these were the Bills).  

Often the team that losses the Super Bowl misses the playoffs the next year.  

Nothing is guaranteed

OH COME ON., THATS FKG SEXISM. AND THAT NEED TO STOPS

It still amazes me that Whitney sang at the superbowl and it was her first take of the track. She had that much magic. Her doc on Netflix still makes me so sad and in awe.

@gmfb The Chiefs are probably going to be their own worst enemy. Little bit easier winning a super bowl when you have a 40 million-dollar quarterback playing for 1M. Once he gets paid it'll be harder to keep talent in KC

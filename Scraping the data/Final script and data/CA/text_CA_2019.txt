So nice to get a call from our son Laith today asking for advice about the chilli recipe he is working on for his Super Bowl chili. The recipe includes beef short ribs as well as all kinds of exotic peppers and some weird ingredients such as marmite and anchovies.

Nachos count as dinner.

And not just on Super Bowl Sunday.

Felt good to get that off my chest.

Of course want Rams to win, but feel Pats will take it. See a blowout as well, McVay is exactly half the age of Belichick, could get schooled big time here. Gurley not a 100%, could see Goff having a deer-in-the-headlights type moment. Sense a 37-17 type game. #SuperBowl

I watch maybe 2, at most 3 NFL games a year. I don't like the league. I'm still going to a Super Bowl party with my family because it's good food, good company and an excuse to have a good time. I don't care who wins. But I also don't go telling people they how much I dont care.
The good news... big 1-0 win vs Sens in semis and moving onto the finals vs Limoilou Titans.  The bad news... missing the Superbowl and getting home after midnight. #GoWildcats https://t.co/4czJmzS9XY
@BarryGarelick @greg_ashman I must think and respond. That will give me something to do during the Super Bowl. 😁

For all those posting 'we don't care about the super bowl' things... That's great. Care to list a bajillion other things you also don't care about? I mean, it's suuuuuper important that you inform everyone of your uncaring.
Or. You know. Don't? Maybe? It's fine you don't care.

A couple of years prior I can never forget the doubt I had saying to myself if the Patriots would ever go back and win another Super Bowl. That was 5 years ago. Well they went on to win SB 49 that year and have gone to 4 of the past 5 Super Bowls since. Enough said. LFG.

Tonight when your team loses the super bowl in overtime, remember that the cfl is superior in that it gives both teams a fair chance 💁🏼‍♂️
Do you think more money is spent on/for this day, super bowl Sunday, than Christmas all together?

If your pet loses hair it’s call Shedding. If a person loses weight it’s known as Shedding a few pounds. In Newfoundland during Super Bowl most of us head to the backyard sheds to watch the game. Giving another meaning to SHEDDING. No better place to watch it.

Super Bowl predictions.... I’m taking Brady to do it again!
Thanks @Bell @Bell_Support . Super Bowl Sunday, and once again, your shit Internet is ruining everything. 3 hours on the phone, now I have to wait for a tech later this week. Love Fibe TV but your internet service is so terrible. Should of stayed with Rogers. https://t.co/7lMg4E96ZC
Super Bowl Thread 

I am rooting for the Patriots today mainly because their coach, Bill Belichick, has no professional football playing experience. He played high school and college football but was mainly a lacrosse player.

No Fun League: don't tackle receivers after they're caught the ball. Tackle them after they've gained more yards after the catch. Must be a #Patriots rule. #Superbowl
I love #DareMeStats like “no one has ever missed a field goal in this building.” #MissedIt
#SBLIII #SuperBowl #PatsGetNuthin

Field Goal attempt by #NewEnglandPatriots is NO GOOD!!! 😃😂

New twist to the super bowl. Defense!
Both defense are amazing those far #SuperBowl
Halftime with Maroon 5. Time to do literally anything else before the 3rd quarter. #SuperBowl
Admit that @tonyromo is great on TV. Great insight and colour commentating. #Magic #TonyRomoMagic #SB53 #SuperBowl2019
3-0 @ halftime. woooow #SuperBowl
Super Bore @Patriots @RamsNFL Terrible First Half  wondering if the Rams will make any Offensive Plays in the Second Half #SuperBowl
I appreciate good defenses but damn, it’s not even entertaining defense with big hits etc.  Whats worse, I’m in Canada and can’t even see the good commercials!! #SuperBowl
Nothing better than a 3-0 halftime game said nobody in #SuperBowl history.
Damn this game sucks. Most boring Super Bowl I’ve ever seen.
Well that was one half of football that I will never get back #SMH #Superbowl

Don't tell me the #SuperBowl is boring, I'm seeing great plays all over the field. That punt was absolutely gorgeous 😶
This is Tom Brady’s worst superbowl ever.

@garyvee @vaynermedia @tySchmitt5 @davidrocknyc I think that it would be awesome to be at the HQ during super bowl weekend to see how the execution of the social goes.. that would be one hell of a contest to win!  (Or at the very least have #dailyvee running during this time)
What is the most boring SUPER bowl ever?? This must be it! 3-0. @NFL @nflcommish @Paul__Jones at least the Chili is the BEST! @EuropeanTour #2ndlowest

Everyone on Brady 5 super bowl wins. Hall of Fame guarantee. But why do t we talk about him losing to Eli Manning... Twice 🤣😂 #SuperBowlLIII
Another year down, still haven’t  watched superbowl, dunno what the hype is all about
Super Bowl ads: all robots, mermaids and hot black men. I’ll take it.
The Patriots are going to win this 6-0 because they don't think all of sports fandom hates them quite enough yet. #SuperBowl

@79mpresident @UniforTheUnion @CTV I def support the #PatriotsNation Super Bowl commercial as a @LearCorporation employee for 15 yrs
A penguin came on screen during the Super Bowl and I screamed.
The Google “translate” commercial is my favourite #SuperBowl spot thus far.
Holy hell!!! I’m drunk and fat.
Thank you @SuperBowl 
For twisting my rubber arm to eat junk food!!!
superbowl party.
@ckendall77 Yep exactly but doesn't help with the brutal officiating I've already seen two non calls on the Pats just ridiculous #Superbowl #RamsHouse
So far the commercials have been more entertaining then the game itself. #SuperBowlAds #SuperBowl2019 #SBLlll
#Patriots strike first with a FG take a 3-0 lead #NEvsLA #SuperBowl
I don’t know why I’m surprised the Canadian stream of the super bowl is playing Canadian brand commercials but it’s making me much less interested in them
What a hit .. Wow.

The Super Bowl is cool, but the commercials have been interrupted a few times by a couple of football plays.
#SuperBowlLlll
@AlbertsonB2 I am on Twitter and organizing bath time instead of watching the Super Bowl. Part of me wishes my social conscience and politics didn't override my appreciation of football. But here we are.😭
Game Of Thrones and Bud Light just won the #SuperBowl
Bud Light aligning itself with the Lannisters is such a perfect match, really. #SuperBowl #GOT
#GameOfThrones
Everyone here agrees the best possible #SuperBowl commercial would just be a man sitting in a room who just says, “Hey we’re McDonalds and we’re bringing our pizza back.” Cut to black.
I’m extremely confused by these bud light commercials... but they obviously spent a lot of money on them... #SuperBowl2019

I may be the first person in the history of Super Bowl TV to purposely switch from watching American feed to watching Canadian feed.  Reinstate the simulcast, @CRTCeng you are costing Canadian TV stations millions for what?  A bunch of loud, obnoxious and stupid commercials.

Disclaimer:

For as horrible as this game has been, if there are three scores in the last five minutes and one is a last-second score to win, many will call it the best #SuperBowl finish in recent memory. It’s just how it goes.
I usually struggle to sleep on Sundays. Thanks to #SuperBowl that won’t be a problem! #yawner #PatriotsvsRamsLive #NFL

Thank you @maroon5 and in particular @adamlevine for peeling off the jersey at the @SuperBowl halftime show. Only reason why I woke up and can still watch this low scoring game... 🥴😴
If one more man at this Super Bowl viewing party obnoxiously yells “Oh SHIT!” at a seemingly insignificant moment of game play... I will continue to sit here and silently stew.

Loving this Super Bowl, but I'm a huge fan of punting. Very under-appreciated aspect of the game. More punts!!! #SuperBowl53
Hey @NFL i'm sure glad you fucked over the @Saints to get the @RamsNFL into the @SuperBowl. Everyone would have hated an exciting game.

If you like punting this is the best super bowl ever
I don’t know why, but I think it’d be funny if the GOAT won his 6th super bowl 3-0.
I hope the @NFL “purists” who complained that last year’s #SuperBowl was too open ended and needed more defence are satisfied.
There’s gonna be a lot of kids inspired to be punters this year and we should all be thankful for that. #SuperBowl

Good Lord, the #SuperBowl is now such that we're now praising the punting game as the exciting portion of the night ... anyone have a copy of the Grey Cup, I remember competitive and entertaining football, I do, I do ...
A punt is the most exciting play at the #SuperBowl...
#superbowl
#SuperBowl2019 forget this damn game where’s the @Marvel Avengers Endgame trailer 😄
So glad this Rams offence is in this game over the Saints. They’ve been so exciting to watch! #SuperBowl
Please allow one of the punters to somehow end up game MVP. #SuperBowl
It this the worst #SuperBowl in the history of the @NFL? What do the @RamsNFL have to do to pretend they belong in this game? Give their defense a gold star for keeping them alive... somehow.
#superbowl
The Patriots need to somehow get Julian Edelman more involved in this game. #SuperBowl2019

A team has never been shutout in the #superbowl I’m hoping this tweet jinxes that and the Rams make this game interesting. Don’t want a Patriots 3-0 win, only D-Coordinators will love this game.

Hope You are Enjoying the Super Bowl and the Half Time Show. 

Super Bow LIII (Super Bowl 53)
New England Patriots and Los Angeles Rams.

My guy Edelman is the only guy that's doing anything #SuperBowl
@Edelman11 has been $$$ today 😎 #SuperBowl #Patriots
#edelman that man is crazy #SuperBowl

Tom Brady could use on of those deflated footballs right about now... #Superbowl #deflategate
Me: Wow, this Super Bowl half-time show is really bad. Adam Levine sounds flatter than his abs. 
Adam Levine: *Crap, we’re tanking; better take off my shirt and show off my abs*
Me: Hmmm...nope, still bad. 
#SuperBowl2019
Edelman MVP #SuperBowl
Only Jerry Rice was a better postseason receiver than Julian Edelman is. Come playoff time, he’s a lead-pipe lock. He’s unstoppable. #SuperBowl #SBLIII https://t.co/0iwNgffkTq
Well that #HalftimeShow was pretty fucking boring. 

Bring back #JustinTimberlake and #JanetJackson

#SuperBowl #SuperBowl2019 #SuperBowlLIII @NFL
Any chance Tony Romo can coach the Rams in second half. Or play QB #SuperBowl2019
This Edelman guy seems like an asset. #SuperBowl
The #SuperBowl ads - however - have been entertaining https://t.co/I2eKVbwc7q
@TaraSetmayer Prince -  Super Bowl XLI 🏈  |  Halftime Show 2007   FULL SHOW HD https://t.co/hzDT7iy0wk via @YouTube
I was so bored during the
#HalftimeShow I loaded the dishwasher. #SuperBowl
Both punters for MVP. #SuperBowl
Edelman again. Fuck him #SuperBowl
EDELMANNNNNNNNNNN!!! #SuperBowl
Goodell calling both teams. #SuperBowl2019 #snooze https://t.co/gRVRRSbIoC
Ça ressemble plus à un match de Coupe Grey #SuperBowl2019 pis je suis généreux. Mais il faut que les arbitres s’en mêle pour avoir un bon match!
if i wasn’t clear enough #superbowlhalftimeshow was 1 of the worst ever. but, hey...when u hear ur pitchy voice in the monitors, just take ur shirt off 🙄 #adamlevine #Maroon5. and #TravisScott is a musical genius?! huh? #SuperBowl #SuperBowlLIII
I went to watch a football game and a hockey game broke out. 3:0. Bruins over Kings!  Wait... #SuperBowl
Ok I would've like the halftime show if that Travis Scott opening actually did include more of "Sweet Victory". I would've been down for a sicko mode remix. #Superbowl https://t.co/fDqqreIshJ
A the #SuperBowl  gathering decided to mimic #Maroon5 singer Adam Levine by ending the half-time shirtless.  It did not garner the same reaction, though I do have a neighbourhood restraining order now
You know it’s a game right? With highly paid players and a boat load of sponsorship adds, but still a Game... #SuperBowl2019
#superbowl food tweet: I made my rice krispie squares with brown butter and butterscotch chips and baby, it's on
Honestly at this point I would rather re-watch Super Bowl LI
I speak for all canadians who could give zero fucks about the superbowl, we watch because of the commercials #goat #GoPatsGo
This time next year on Super Bowl Sunday we will have cannabis infused beverages in Canada but they won’t be advertised on tv. That is banned under C-45 the Federal Cannabis Act.
When the Patriots win 3-0 it’s going to be really interesting to see how the media makes the win all about Tom Brady. #SuperBowl
#SuperBowl Watched game sick at home, could have napped through 3 quarters. Snoozer if there ever was one.

ITS GOOD!!!! PATS WILL WIN THE SUPER BOWL
This Super Bowl is the this year's Super Bowls halftime show of Super Bowls.
This is what the #Saints died for??

#SuperBowl
Ugh. 

@Patriots fans are the WORST 🙄 

#Patriots #SuperBowl53 #SuperBowl #NFL
I can't wait to go to work tomorrow to hear from all the 40 year old Patriots fans who never saw Drew Bledsoe take a snap. #superbowl
GO SPORTS! #SuperBowl
Worst Super Bowl ever, NFL owes us a Chiefs-Saints game next Sunday
Who else thought the halftime show was kinda boring?!
#superbowl
The best part of that halftime show was when @adamlevine took his shirt off 😍 #SuperBowlSunday #superbowlhalftimeShow #superbowl
Obviously no one cares about the super bowl cause everyone on ig liking my new pic instead of watching the game
The drama of it all. A measurement. Curling measurements are also much more exciting for the record. #SuperBowl #cbccurl
ASMR made it to the the Super Bowl.
The most enjoyablepart of this game is the T-Mobile commercials #SuperBowl @crystalkharding
Best #superbowl tweet. https://t.co/19nM8YDpTs
Yo refèl ankò gen lè #Patriots #SuperBowl
Turned on the TV at the 2 minute warning. Is Brady gonna pull another one out or....?! #SuperBowl
@DougBrown97 And the Patriots wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for a Chiefs lineman lining up offside #SuperBowl

Was Brady even touched in this game?..

Wow.
#SuperBowl
@NikkF07
@BigRedyyc Looked it up.  Part of the new NAFTA was no Super Bowl ads for CANADA.  True.
Holy fuck LOL happy super bowl Sunday!! https://t.co/smajjro21V
Why didnt Tony Romo know this much about football when he was a QB? #SuperBowl
The legend of Eli Manning lives on. The only person who can beat Tom Brady in the #Superbowl.
Brady will somehow win MVP. #SuperBowl
@eric__79 @JerryPDias @SuperBowl @CTVToronto Oh. Well.  How many corporate ads did you see?  I guess that's ok if the rich do it.  Who needs balance in their world
Damn so close!!!! You've got this @Patriots @PatsNationTM #GoPats #EverythingWeGot #DoYourJob #SuperBowl #NEvsLAR #GronkRocks
Let’s go Rams #SuperBowl
Right now, Julian Edelman is my Super Bowl MVP. #SuperBowl #SBLlll #NFL
#SuperBowl coming down to this next play. And should the Pats get the first down it’s undoubtedly the most boring championship game ever. Full stop.
The not-so-Super Bowl
Pretty jealous of the alternate universe of ours where everyone is enjoying a thrilling end to the Saints and Chiefs Super Bowl

Most boring Super Bowl in the history of the world ...
Is it just me, or are the @Patriots &amp; @RamsNFL playing like they know that if they win the game, they are visiting @realDonaldTrump at the #WhiteHouse?! 😂🤣

#SuperBowl ##SuperBowlLlll #WhiteHouse
This experiment with 9-minute-long #NFL games shows promise, I think. #Superbowl
Bellichek's plan: run the ball, save Brady from being in the pocket too much &amp; keep the Rams offense on the sidelines .. brilliant.

#Superbowl
@ShannonSharpe
@MarieCC ... jamais bon de faire une passe alors qu’on est en déséquilibre en direction du CB Gilmore. Ceci entraîne cela. Et maintenant les 3 dernières minutes prendront 25 minutes avec les temps d’arrêt🙄. Patriotes 17 à 3 au final et au SuperBowl pour encore les 5 prochaines années😏
Intense. #SuperBowl
And the Patriots shouldn't even be in this position if it weren't for the Chiefs lineman who lined up offside. #SuperBowl
@cashmobstalbert @bublywater @MichaelBuble @SuperBowl Made me lol!
This game tho 😴🤦‍♀️😭
At least Romo finally made it to a SB 🤣🏈

I spent years watching super bowl; then concussion awareness happened. So, I watched half time shows. Today, I watched neither.
Say what you want about #TomBrady , but no one will get 7 QB Super Bowl championships to beat his 6th record Won today.  Unless his name is Tom Brady #SuperBowlSunday #SuperBowlLlll #SuperBowl53

@Drewber66 You can watch any commercial that you want online. It is a good thing that our Canadian networks that have to pay for rights to cover the Super Bowl actually get to help pay for their content by playing their sponsors’ ads.
Tom Brady has more rings than the Olympics.

#SuperBowl #TomBrady
It's been a good night for all #Boston franchise fans out there.. 💙💚💛 @Patriots @celtics @NHLBruins #BostonStrong #SuperBowl #GOAT
Tom Brady Wins His 6th Superbowl Ring &amp; Thats Why #TB12 Is The Goat 🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐
Edelman missed the first four games for PED's violation, and ends with a Superbowl MVP. Not even a mention on the broadcast. Huge difference from MLB.
The @Patriots 2019 #SuperBowl Champions 🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆 https://t.co/IrHDdMDpqp
@SilverD90001857 @abc7Richard @JoyAnnReid @abcnews Not this Super Bowl.
@wai0937 Super Bowl follow up show on CBS Best in the World has 75+ judges from many countries, including Anderson Silva.
Not the most entertaining game but the Pats got the job done. Worthy #SuperBowl Champions. As for Tom Brady, I hope people understand we are witnessing the Greatest Of All Time. We really are and how fortunate we are to be able to see it #EverythingWeGot #SBChamps https://t.co/dUmR6pkg5o

Worst SuperBowl I've seen in years, AND the Patriots scraped out a win. 

Not sure what could make this night worse.

Get rid of the halftime show, and the 2 week break = better #SuperBowl
@MatteoLane Or how about instead of Super Bowl altogether - just Golden Girls reruns for three hours?
When Obama was president we had the iconic Beyoncé and Bruno Mars duo at the halftime show 😫😫 wtf was that #SuperBowl2019
Gaming has been an integral part of me growing up. Therefore, this ad hits close to home. Every child, irrespective of gender, ability, race, and economic standing, deserves the chance to play. Kudos to @Microsoft #SuperBowl https://t.co/0zGSq1RKol
And what about the halftime show, I like Maroon 5, but the performance sucked big time. And was it even necessary to take off his shirt?! But I don’t blame him, that was one ugly tank. #SuperBowl2019

As @Taggart7 would put it, #Superbowl or #SuperBore53 was a big XL bowl of whateve-salad.
I don’t think anyone deserve to win that Super Bowl it was so bad,It was New Englands to lose and they didn’t lose it
I didn’t watch the Super Bowl. Do they still do Bud Bowl? Remember it was in 3D one year in like 1990? I could google I suppose but am happy with the haze of memory.
@darrenrovell - Romo, best QB in the stadium.

Who ever produced the Canadian dairy commercial for the Super Bowl is a complete disgrace for all of Canada Ag #SuperBowlLlll #ofa #SuperBowlSunday

Highlights of super bowl party: playing Broom Service, Hanamakoji, and Patchwork with my nephew. The chili was good too. The company was also good. The game was boring and the half time show was equally snoozefest. Commercials won for best on-screen entertainment.
WHERE IS GISELE. #SBLlll #pats #patriots #SuperBowl
I congratulate @MoniqueYip On her team Super Bowl victory I hate it but it was a good win for them
@crockpics @HumbleAnthem Now that would have been an incredible super bowl halftime show!!!!👍👍👍😬😬😬😬😬😬

Super Bowl= worst game end Jubo, worst championship game, worst championship trophy hands down and worst halftime.    #SuperBowl53 #SuperBowl2019 #superbowl why do I watch this sport once a year.
@PresChoice interesting commercial after the Super Bowl. If “everything is better when we eat together”, what are you doing to help EVERYONE eat together?

Come on big Vince, did Versace just win the Super Bowl? No, put on a sweater when you’re caring that trophy! Anyways that’s just my take. You were and are a patriot legend anyways. Go patriots 2020 baby!
@EvanonHB Yeah who would think the defence and running the ball would ever win a super bowl!!
So proud of Julian Edelman overcoming a PED suspension to be named MVP of the least memorable Super Bowl ever.
Congrats @Edelman11 for MVP of SuperBowl LIII 🏈, certainly well earned @Patriots
Congrats MVP! So deserved! #SuperBowl https://t.co/7dhQLb1qR1

#SuperBowl Hey, @NFL how about these suggestions I have for Super Bowl Half Time Show Next Year
1 @backstreetboys 2 @JourneyOfficial 
3 @NSYNC should reunite 
It will be going to be a super fun half time show if this gonna happen next year! make this trending! #NFL @nflnetwork
When I type 'Super', my predicted text goes immediately to 'Junior'. Not 'Man', not 'Bowl'. And that is everything you need to know about me.
A TWITTER VIDEO OF SICKO MODE IN THE BUBBLE BOWL MADE IT TO THE SUPER BOWL, this is such a sizeable victory for our beautiful platform
#NFL のルールは複雑でしたが、キャリア6回目の勝利を果たした41歳のBradyに感銘を受けました。当たり前の事だけれど難しい、挑戦し続ける事の大切さをまた教わった気がします。#SuperBowl
@TurfShowTimes @SBNation Maybe the “fans” will show up if they ever get back to another super bowl!
Vraiment pas un fan des pats, mais je dois être honnête, en tant que fan de sports nous sommes chanceux d’assister à l’ère Tom Brady. #SuperBowl2019

A well timed follow up to my tweet from yesterday about the value of journalism, here’s this beautiful @WashingtonPost spot narrated by Tom Hanks, featured during the SuperBowl. @IreneGentle, I think you’ll appreciate this.

Congratulations to the New England Patriots for winning their sixth Super Bowl.
They could have called that the Super Bad Bowl but that would have been an insult to this guy https://t.co/DtpQARTuNw
y'all are watching the super bowl but i bet nobody's dick gets sliced open at the end like in SISTERS
The NHL does the best championship trophy presentation in all of sports. 

The NFL owner just tosses it aside like a paper weight. 🙄

Maybe it’s just getting old that the Patriots keep winning. Haha. #SuperBowl2019
@skellerfarms Actually they have only moved into the same category as the Steelers-6 Super Bowl Championships.
@JeffTetz @Patriots @SuperBowl You are the definition of a true fan my friend. Congratulations to your Patriots. Six Superbowls is a historic achievement.

Such hypocrisy by @NFL at #SuperBowl2019 in Atlanta: honouring the legacy of MLK while shunning Colin Kaepernick for taking a knee for upholding what MLK fought so hard for.

@ohrnberger Hmm..you were doing well until that last line: McVay/Goff the main reason the offence stunk it out!! Worst play calling in history of Super Bowl and Goff didnt once check off at line...played like a little school 👧...did they throw once to the tight end??Karma.. New Orleans game
@PartyPriyaPanda @KISSOnline i remember watching them do the super bowl halftime show on tv with my family in ‘98. that was basically how i convinced them to bring me to see them live. i was obsessed. i am obsessed.

The media scrum around #TB12 at the end of the #SuperBowl gave me anxiety just watching it. I can’t imagine being in the middle of that sweaty mass of writhing bodies. Use the damn zoom on your camera people!
Because of Super Bowl ads, I’ve had &gt;that&lt; song stuck in my head all day. 

Then I realized it’s morphed in my head as “Moves Like Shatner.”

I’m good now.

They’re saying Brady is the goatman. Happy Soup Bowl to him and his ball chums. #SuperBowl2019
Experience vs the inexperience. This #Rams team looked like a team going to the superbowl for the first time. Hopefully this is a learning experience and they come back just as strong. Hopefully. #NFL
So Edelman goes from doing steroids in the offseason to winning the Super Bowl at the end of the season.

Congrats @Patriots on #SuperBowl Edelman is a beast. And best part is Josh Gordon will be getting a ring!
As “close” football games go, that is the worst one I can recall. #SuperBowl2019
A pink Ibanez guitar or a fluffy fur coat is just not enough to save anyone from that disaster. #SuperBowl #superbowlhalftimeShow
@TerriClarkMusic @SuperBowl Somewhat interesting, mostly disappointing like the game!
Sure, the Super Bowl was terrible and the half time show was abysmal but it at least gives people something to complain about, which they enjoy.
Things my mom said during the super bowl: 
1. “Is this a boring game?”
2. “Who is winning now Red or Blue?”
3. “Is that Puff Daddy?” 
4. “Why does your father have that face? Is he not happy about the score?”
5. “OMG Look at how good Jon Bon Jovi’s hair/ coat/ belt looks” 😆🙈
Not sure who had a worse Super Bowl - Jared Goff or Adam Levine. Voice sounded rough and really did not need to see him take off his shirt.
what the halftime show is supposed to be: 

Prince -  Super Bowl XLI 🏈  |  Halftime Show 2007  https://t.co/TbGsucGa3k via @YouTube
@fertxi14 @emosqueira @Fundeu También prefiero el masculino. Me resulta raro que el español de España no tenga en cuenta el género del objeto (cuenco o copa) por el que se lucha y se fije en «la final-el partido», aplicable a cualquier deporte. Aquí, el francés impone el masculino (La finale du Superbowl).
@phil_torres That's my buddy Toby. He drank too much watching SuperBowl
So, who won the baseball? #SuperbOwl
Most boring super bowl of my life.
...Tener que adelantarle al minuto 12 del Half time show del #SuperBowl para llegar al bonito momento en el que @adamlevine se quita la playera...
SuperBowl Champs @Patriots
Today was #superbowl however....this was one of the most boring games I have watched. Yay for the Patriots but...let the cheating accusations and scandals start
Can’t wait for the Browns to be in the Super Bowl next year, Bake and the boys will give the people a real game
Why didn't @lindsayell perform the halftime show? That could've saved the Superbowl. She would've rocked it. #SuperBowl #superbowlhalftimeShow https://t.co/qtAWwJd9hR

Disappointed in this year’s Superbowl and disappointed in my tummy for not being able to keep up with my consumption of Cheetos tonight
@_npryan This was exactly 7.3 times more exciting than the actual not so super bowl
@chrisdowning @catdadsupreme2 White men can do what black people cant: a super bowl story
After the last 2 Super Bowls we were due for a dud, but I’m sure Tom Brady doesn’t care, he can now put a ring on his other hand #SuperBowl https://t.co/9ZigdjLt3B
@JesusSaves_Broo Happy birthday Joppy. It's also #superbowl day. I wanted Tom Brady and #Patriots to win and they won. Thanks for being a good friend to me and sending support. I'm wishing you a good year.
Congratulations my boys Super Bowl champs again  for the 6th Time in franchise history ties the @steelers record for the most  woo!!!! 13-3 final what a game The 🐐 #TB12 feels so good to be a fan of this great team for a long time #6ixring #PatriotsNation @Patriots
Slapped* the super bowl champs https://t.co/H159bstQmk
Probably the shittiest half time show of super bowl history
Superbowl shmuperbowl.
Adam Levine showed his nipples during the Super Bowl halftime show and didn't get in trouble.
@mattyglesias @humantransit Designing ANY system for a Super Bowl is wasteful
I ate half a McCain cake tonight and didn’t throw up this is my Super Bowl
Never ever said this before and actually refused to say it for stubborn reasons. Tom Brady is indisputably the greatest QB of all time. Not his best game tonight but when it counted , made the key throw to Gronk to set up the only TD. #SuperBowl
Worst. 
Super Bowl. 
Halftime show. 

EVER.

Thank you! @Patriots I've been battling bad depression lately and one thing that brightens my day is Pats football. Hope to one day see a game in Foxboro. #SuperBowl #StillHere #PatsNation
Today my pastor said he’d rather watch people play darts that the super bowl and I felt that 😭
Yep the Super Bowl this year was a complete bust no doubt. But let’s not forget that 50% of NFL games on a weekly basis are completely unwatchable and similarly sloppy. #facts
Gotta love winning $700 on the Super Bowl 🤑🤑
@LizSpeidel Guess what I did during the 4th qu of the SuperBowl? I bought your book, See Me: Book One: To Love a Woman on Amazon. Should be here in a day or 2. That was way more fun than watching Brady win another SB. Interested in how she comes up with 30 fantasies in 30 days.
Best part of #SuperBowl2019 is that it's over. And so is football season. 🤷‍♀️ Didn't even bother to watch, not the half-time show, nothing. Based on my news feeds, I didn't miss much. #MovingOn
@Zachary_Baer Here’s a list of results for the main ones: https://t.co/Z3RvrZoLHJ
@Jvh927 @scott_pianowski @MarkStopa That's why they're 10/10 in the super bowl!
Missed the Super Bowl cause I was on a plane, but watching highlights from Boston Pizza in Yellowknife and holy fuck those refs were atrocious. Fire the whole lot of them.
2017 Super Bowl: James notWhite, 6 carries, 14 rec, 139yds &amp; 3 TDs = Brady MVP.
2019 Super Bowl: Jewlian Edelman 10 rec, 141 yds = MVP
Adam Levine au SuperBowl 😍👌 #SuperBowl #Maroon5

I’m sorry to say that but video games competitions are way more exciting to watch than the Super Bowl. What a boring game.
🏆Congrats to the New England Patriots in winning this year's SuperBowl. Party saf, rest up and hope to see you compete in another SuperBowl in the future. 🏈 GO PATRIOTS GO 🏈  #SuperBowl #NewEnglandPatriots @Pats_Superbowl
This Super Bowl taught me that they do not have to seriously promo #GameofThrones because we are all going to watch it anyways.

I wasted 4 hours of my life I’ll never get back watching that SuperBowl. There was NOTHING memorable about any PART of that game. Where’s Janet’s nipple when you need it? At least something to talk about.

Superbowl was crap. Half time was whatever. Commercials were pathetic. Pats winning was horrible. Not impressed at all this year. Except for my homemade nachos, bruschetta and wings.
Thank God the halftime show was so bad. #SuperBowl

That #SuperBowl clearly reasserted the #NFL’s superiority over the bush-league Canadian game, amirite? 🙄

Not denying incredible athleticism of NFL players or its status as the world’s dominant gridiron league ... by a mile. But maybe the #CFL haters could take it down a notch.
Patriots!!!! #weready#werestillhere #SuperBowl⁠ ⁠ #SuperBowlLIII Logan isn’t even 1 and she’s seen a @RedSox World Series and a @Patriots Super Bowl win!!! #proudBostonfan
Prior to tonight, largest margin of victory for #Patriots in a #SuperBowl was 8 points. So with this 13-3 #SuperBowl2019 win was their most dominant #SuperBowl win. 
Though, I’d rather not watch such a dominant win again.
Parabéns ao menino Brady, jogando muito

An exceptionally boring #SuperBowl awakens restless critics. The world has an excess amount of criticism over anything superficial and yet there’s passivity over the issues that merit constructive critiques.
@GregCKXS You forgot

The super bowl was on?

In your poll
So very happy for the Patriots!  To be totally honest with you we felt the Rams shouldn't have been in the Superbowl to begin with, the #NonCall was the only reason the Saints weren't playing, total rip-off!  From Nikkiyyc https://t.co/BiviiqV0KA

So interesting to the see people who throughout the year rave, retweet and highlight the NFL’s terrible history, continued policies and actions, support Kaepernick even, and yet still show up to watch the Super Bowl like the above for one night means nothing.
@crapules Le SuperBowl met un groupe qui accepte de jouer gratis la. Ce groupe était peut être l'option DD des Flacons
13-3.......

That was the #SuperBowl score?????

Fuck, I’ve seen higher scores when the Canadian Junior Hockey team plays some loser country in Round Robin play during the World Juniors.

@NFL This video was far more entertaining than the 2019 super bowl was.   Thanks for posting.
Super bowl. There was nothing SUPER about it. Two high school teams would have played a better game. The MVP  was caught doping. That's the best player? Colin Kaepernick is banned for life for kneeling and this jackass gets rewarded. Neither team should take pride in that fiasco.

Tony Romo’s commentary was the only reason why I ended up watching the whole Super Bowl, the man is gifted on the mic. Can’t wait to hear him again next season.

@RekedFantasy For the record this isn’t just a Super Bowl take. I’ve been hammering the fact that Goff is what will (and did) hold his team back. Obviously I could be wrong but it seems fairly clear to me.
As a sports-ambivalent family, last night we watched Won’t You Be My Neighbor, a leisurely paced doc about a mild-mannered children’s show host. From everything I’ve read this morning about the Super Bowl it would seem that we had the more exciting viewing experience.
Didn’t watch a minute of the NFL this year nor a minute of the Super Bowl. The NFL has shown it’s true colors and I will not support an organization that silences their employees and sees them as “inmates running the prisons.” #KneelForJustice ✊🏽

@markwschaefer If I am not mistaken, the whole medieval “dilly dilly” ad program was “born” during the SuperBowl last year, or the year before? I think they just killed it off. The BudLightKnight was killed &amp; did the dragon not enflame the entire viewing stand possibly killing all?

With all the hype around the "terrible" superbowl performance, I have to wonder...Was it really that bad? As in, bad enough to warrant checking it out, when I could instead spend time listening to @dvntownsend  or checking out newly discovered bands like @Gatesmorning ? Hmm....
Okay, so *this* is definitely the best thing about the Super Bowl. https://t.co/aFK4o8UwUD

@CannataNFL @ChefLandry_ @alexmarvez Is nobody surprised by this? Greatest HC of all time, 9 Super Bowl appearances in what 18 years? 6 wins. Working with the greatest QB of all time. And you trade it all in for mediocrity in Miami? What am I missing? Is the end near for Bellichick?

For the record, the Pittsburgh Steelers defeated the Rams by a score of 31-19 (consequently winning their fourth Super Bowl in six years).

I’m not saying it’s not worth pointing out but this is not a surprise 🤷🏻‍♀️ #superbowl
Everyone's pointing out or asking why it's alright for Adam Levine to take his shirt off at the Super Bowl but Janet Jackson was dragged for ages when she had a wardrobe malfunction.
Why? We all know why.

Listen, it's not that it was low scoring that made the super bowl dull. It's that there were so few big, pivotal plays. It was a grind it out affair. I was still riveted but there wasnt alot to raise the heartbeat. #nfl #SuperBowl2019

@10jmcda @acoyne His comment about the Super Bowl ads - that they all "suck"  - will inform you about his values. The Washington Post ad either went right over his head, or he really doesn't believe the press should tell the truth.
Brandin cooks made more this year than superbowl MVP edelman has made his whole career... wowza
How did Canadians react to this year’s Super Bowl ads?  #SuperbowlLIII @Methodifyit https://t.co/ohKVZrkKXr

heard a good amount of people say that the Super bowl was boring.. I guess because the numbers weren’t high on the score board or whatever, but the game was absolutely amazing.. the defence.... the defence on BOTH teams were absolutely amazing. holy shit, it was so great to watch

@hels honestly if all of the People Who Would Die For Dan Levy (Should He Need Us To) banded together we could probably win the super bowl if we wanted to
@gbraud I think they have an issue they need to respond too. The Super Bowl brand is to ingrained in culture to have this bring it down.

Yes, the Super Bowl has less viewership because of Patriots fatigue and it had nothing to do with the Rams having 150 fans.

In comparison, “there were 32.3 million social media interactions across official Facebook, Instagram and Twitter accounts and fan Twitter accounts about Super Bowl LIII on CBS on Feb. 3, 2019” #torontomarketing #advertising
Unsure if advertising on TV is a smart tactic? Well, if you’re strategic with timing and TV events it can be worth your while. Nielsen reported 49.3mm homes/98.2mm viewers tuned into the Super Bowl on Sunday. https://t.co/O6B50DKvgT

So I just watched the Super Bowl halftime show...that was terrible
@CH4Chefs That would be the Super Bowl which occurred last Sunday.

@deesnider How about we just forgetting the Super Bowl and start a festival tour called 80’s Metal Fest? At least then the real lovers of the music get a chance to unite and support their favourite bands.
And ready for the @Browns to reach the super bowl. It’s happening this season.
@deesnider @NFL Exactly.  We wanna Rock when it’s super Bowl time. Clowns at NFL want to dance.
I won $70 betting on the Super Bowl this year, so I guess something good came out of that boring ass game

Crazy how with all the recap of #SuperBowl going on somehow nobody is talking about McCourty picking up blown coverage and essentially saving the game with the pass breakup in the endzone. One of the most important plays in the whole game.

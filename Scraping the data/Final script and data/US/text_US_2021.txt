Gathering virtually or with the people you live with is the safest way to stay healthy and protect those around you, especially with how COVID variants are spreading so easily.

A company spends 5.5 million dollars for 30 seconds on the Super Bowl.

The company also spends even more to produce the commercial.

I would rather take that money and produce a weekly show on YouTube and grow an audience.

Or a newsletter!

What would you do with 6 million?

The NFL and NFLPA began preliminary negotiations last month on the 2021 salary cap, which some believe will end up higher than expected. It’s one of several key issues as the sides brace for another unusual offseason, with Super Bowl LV days away.

@TyDunne I bought my mom a set of Packers DVDs with the original broadcast. Of the 10 games on the set, Summerall and Madden called the 1996 and 1997 NFC Championship games and Super Bowl XXXI. We still watch those games occasionally just to hear those voices. The voices of football.

@antonfilms226 @AndrewLiv @PFF Keeping Chase is a no-brainer. Washington won Super Bowls with Theismann, Williams and Rypien. None of were top tier QB’s. Chase is now the heart and soul of the team. He is our Ray Lewis (who BTW won a Super Bowl with Trent  Dilfer as QB).

So is there a super bowl this year? I literally haven’t heard anything about football in ages.
I had a blast volunteering for the super bowl here in Atlanta. Got so much cool shit.. I was already approved and on the roster to do the final four last year... damn covid.
I was so salty I didn’t get picked to volunteer for the super bowl committee in Tampa.. I get it though. They cut the numbers from needing 3,000 volunteers to only 500.

This year’s Super Bowl is gonna suck🥲
@ThatGirlAubreyy I mean and Goff has been to a couple pro bowls he’s no slouch lol but yeah I get it lol I’m 100% sure that if Matt was on that Rams super bowl team against the Patriots they probably would’ve won lol so he’s clearly better but I’m not writing Goff either lol

Been saying it for like 10 years, no one’s beating this anthem. Super Bowl, olympics, inauguration, movie, whatever. No one’s touching Whitney. In fact I’ll take it a step further, the crowd noise should be removed to make this the official national recording. I’m not kidding. https://t.co/HqSCeHF2j9

Super Bowl parties are a fantastic tradition—you get showered with compliments on your eggplant dip, everyone gives their hot take on the halftime show, and, if we’re lucky, there’s a thrilling football game to top it all off.
One thing I hope covid takes away is the kissing of the Super Bowl trophy. 🤢

@Ryan_Redbeard Did you know this is the first year a team will be playing in their home stadium unfortunately the Super Bowl?  🤯
@sexysaban @Tonelli2Nystrom @EliManning Agree 100%

The guy is another Trent Dilfer, Joe Flacco, Brad Johnson, with an extra super bowl

Steve Young effect

The only reason why they make a big deal about Eli. Like Young, he was able to get the monkey off his back. Living under a shadow Young/Montana, Eli/Peyton
@DBAAU2021 @GregSwartz Comical? Lol okay bud 👌🏼

Look .... Both are great. But both are in different situations. Brady is in a win NOW situation while Belichick is in a REBUILD situation.

So to say or think “Brady’s better bc he’s in the #SuperBowl &amp; Belichick isn’t” Is laughable
Maholmes throws an INT at plus money? Play of the game? Go bet it your welcome. 16 dropped INT int this year, was shaky last super bowl, best rush against a depleted OL! Like my friend Luke always says... Fucking lay it!

@TSteegeNFL Right? Carson is NOT the one who should be dissappointed. His backup won a superbowl and they paid carson and get rid of that guy! A decision I agreed with and still do. But likez carson is the one who let the team down, not the other way around.

@WFSBWendell Pro football was not widely viewed outside of the NE US, even though it had been around for 30+ years at that point. Stadiums only held 45 to 50k, and rarely sold out. First superbowl was in Greenbay in January, hard ticket to sell in those days. We've come a long way, better?

The easiest route to a SuperBowl is draft a qb who excels fast and build a great team around him while his cap is still average for a qb and use that money to stack up other positions. That’s what the chiefs did, Seattle with Russell, 49ers with kap, etc

The Super Bowl is this weekend?
@k1ngcoopa24 It’s truly amazing a QB that devoid of talent and accuracy lead a team to a Super Bowl while being top 5 in many QB statistical categories.  How often do garbage QB’s offenses end up second overall in scoring despite not have a real WR until week 7? 49ers O will be just fine.

The biggest concern for covid rn is the super bowl. Since it’s such a grave concern, you would think they will cancel or postpone it.
@nckhui ...IF all safety protocols are followed and that means people need to be 6 feet apart. Why would you have to be 6 feet apart from everyone everywhere you go except in a school? Why can you not have a Super Bowl party but you can have 20 students in your room? Smh....

Unpopular opinion: the #SuperBowl is more spectacle than sport. 20-25 minutes of actual play in 3+ hours. It’s performance art, punctuated by countless replays, dramatic personal backstories and TV time outs. Absolute waste of time. Except for half-time.

@OcksWRLD All of those didn’t matter when you guys were 11-0 tho right? You guys started losing when Big Ben started player bad, it’s just a fact bro😂😂 i know the WRs dropped a lotttt of balls trust me but w Brady on that team they win the super bowl 110% and it’s not even debatable

Someone come and check my temperature.
@tbhardon90 @RobKnight35 @jagz_19 I didn’t because I feel only the people whose teams have been to or won a super bowl should be allowed.

@Blackvillain22 @MalcomRiley22 Mahomes is a generational quarterback no doubt. Tom Brady has seven Super Bowl rings he just knows how to win these games. It’s going to come down to one interception or a fumble watch but it’s going to be a great game.

I love sports but watching the headlines scroll on ESPN tonight is disheartening.  Millions of dollars spent on Super Bowl bets &amp; baseball salaries when so many Americans are struggling?  Something has got to change.

@_FALCOHOL_ we still aint healed from this. Every Super Bowl with Brady in it after that has had me numb.
@DaWindyCityFS IMO The Bears will not win a Super Bowl while Mack is in his prime. So if the cap hit could be accommodated, I make the deal. I’d also start the rebuild and have others age 30+ follow. However, I doubt a team would give that haul for Mack.

@pfoeller You can't rely on that type of data in sports! There's always going to be the exception. Those same naysayers didn't expect Mahomes to throw over 5000 yards his 1st full season and continue that remarkable ability into the next year and win a Super Bowl.  And yet here he is again
Nick Foles really won a super bowl... https://t.co/wb8e7JF61X
In case you haven’t seen the @TampaBayLV images projected on the Sykes building in downtown @CityofTampa. 

Only 3 more sleeps until we find out if Tom Brady wins his 7th or if Patrick Mahomes wins his 2nd Super Bowl.

my dad just invited me over for superbowl sunday? i didn’t even know football was happening ... guess that’s what happens when you stop surrounding yourself with straight men
i get what they are trying to do with these re-enactments with al and rozelle. but i think i’d rather hear from someone like amy trask.

also, remember that tom flores is the only super bowl winning coach not in the hall of fame. can’t quite figure out what it is about flores 🤔.

@JustinPottinger Justin... come on man. Raiders held them to 40 something points and still won. Bucs defense is better than them and it’s a Brady led offense in the Super Bowl, brady just needs to put A LOT of points on the board
Me having to come into work and cover half a shift on Sunday because the straights don’twant to miss the Super Bowl is homophobic.

@BH12214840 @DJ2LastNames @JJDEMARAY @SKORNorth That would be undervalued, especially when you consider the 49ers would be Super Bowl favorites with Cousins, driving the value of those picks down significantly.
Wrong led the team in passes defensed in both the Atlanta game and Super Bowl. He also led the team in tackles in the Super Bowl. Don’t feed in to BS narratives he was an intricate part through that entire season and a big reason they got the last stop in so many one score games https://t.co/nzDpLqA8R0

In the past year

Tampa Bay Rays (MLB) made the World Series 

Tampa Bay Lightning (NHL) made the Stanley Cup Final

Tampa Bay Buccaneers (NFL) made the Super Bowl

&amp;

Miami Heat (NBA) made the NBA Finals

Why hasn’t anyone talked about Florida’s 1 year sports dominance?
I had me and reagan shirts made for Super Bowl Sunday and I’m so excited to wear them🤩
On Sunday night, Tom Brady will either extend his record as the most-winning Super Bowl QB, or he’ll tie Jim Kelly for the most SB losses (4).
While you’re here you should check out the link in my bio and @PlayBUSR for your super bowl betting needs🤑💰

I said I’d never bet against Brady again. But if I bet him now, I feel like that’s when he will lose. So I’m betting KC. https://t.co/W65OuhGrGs

@SaintsForecast My point is even if he’s healthy (best case scenario), the Saints would be too limited to win the Super Bowl.

Just watched the @ESPN3030 on @Raiders Al Davis.  Loved to hate him because of our beloved #ChiefsKingdom but what a competitor he was.  I admire that.  With that said, @Chiefs  Let’s go win #SuperBowl @NFL @ESPNNFL @NFLonCBS
@timothybased You mean resurrecting a franchise, winning them a super bowl, never missing a game through many injuries only to watch them spend a 1st rounder on a QB to replace him? So he played 3 more years and they shoved him out the door. C’mon

@patrickkeogan @spanky @darrenrovell These guys are jokes...if they won’t take at least 10k on the super bowl they shouldn’t be allowed to operate. So sad. Especially if you’re 5million high on Tampa bay why would you not take a 6 million dollar bet on kc from a “sharp” ?  Just sad.

#SuperBowl prediction:

It will be revealed that the @TomBrady that’s been playing for the @Buccaneers is actually a clone created from the planet Exegol.
Super Bowl game: drink every time an ad references the pandemic. Take a shot if they reference it with a variation on “in these difficult times.” Finish your beer if they say “because we’re all in this together.”
We’ll never see this 2nd half offensive and defensive on slot. This was the defining moment where this debate is it Belichick or Brady was over.

I’m not the biggest football fan but I am actively rooting for Tom Brady to fail spectacularly. He is a huge Trump supporter. Just because he can throw a football doesn’t give him a pass on supporting a dangerous racist. #SuperBowl

@undisputed @ShannonSharpe Skip loves to discredit the pass Mahomes completed to Tyreek in last years Super Bowl as a punt he has to fair catch but I bet if Brady would’ve have completed that pass to Mike Evans he threw up and it was picked off, he’d say it was the greatest pass ever thrown !!
So he’ll fumble on an important 4th quarter possession in the Super Bowl https://t.co/pHuf7HBiXV
The reason that Tom Brady is 43 &amp; in the Super Bowl again is probably because he is vegan or mostly vegan!!! 🌱😋🧠👌🕺🚀🙏♾!!!!!!!

My grandma(dad’s side) was a lifelong Bucs fan. She passed away shortly before their Super Bowl win in ‘03. This Sunday I’ll be cheering them on, with her spirit in mind.
@MorteHoeDevon It’s definitely the pandemic.  Keep in mind the teams are only supposed to arrive today or tomorrow.  There isn’t the usual “super bowl week” activities that you usually see.

If you had the option of going to the Super Bowl with good seats (Front row end zone) or selling those tickets and get a net a 10k which would y’all do?
That Super Bowl better be a toilet that can clean itself. Otherwise I’m not interested in the  #SuperBowl... 🤷🏼‍♂️
Lol @ryanlemond doesn’t know how Brady “drug” last year’s #1 passing offense to the Super Bowl.
@AxactlyAx It's been on Super Bowl highlights every night this week

#FlashbackFriday: Down in South Philly @bigcharlies for the @Chiefs big win during #SuperBowl 54.

Crazy to think that just a few weeks later we’d all begin to start hearing about COVID19.

Such a fun evening. Who do you have taking the trophy this year?
@6abc https://t.co/u6dWQiD7ne
Bonus:
👩🏻‍🦳(person who proudly stated she doesn’t know anything about football): The Super Bowl doesn’t seem as popular this year with people. Is that because of all the *politics*? Kind of ruining the game? 
👩🏽‍🦱: No, I think it’s because of the pandemic.
Excited to join @RTerry740 on @SportsRadio740 at 5pm EST to discuss our latest @D3FBHuddle show, including:

Up to that point, I felt anger the previous times New England won the super bowl.

Nice try but both teams respect each other and BOTH QBs have praised each other during the week. You look foolish. Just sit back, @RealSkipBayless and enjoy the game like the rest of us will. #SuperBowl
🗣 @RealSkipBayless, stop it. Stop creating this false narrative that the Kansas City @Chiefs is disrespecting the @Bucs &amp; in particular, Tom Brady. You're trying to manufacture bulletin board material for your guy that just isn't there. It's not going to work, Skip. #SuperBowl

The #SuperBowl is this Sunday, and even though the Patriots aren't playing this year, we'll still be tuning in! Gathering virtually w/ a #WatchParty or with the people in your bubble is the safest way to celebrate the Super Bowl this year. Check more tips from the @CDCgov! https://t.co/LXmKYqc2Su

U know how the best and coolest super bowl ads get banned before ever airing bc they’re so best and cool? That’s what happens to literally all of my super bowl ads and that’s why you’ve never seen a super bowl ad I wrote.
Some brands play it safe while others go out on a limb.  https://t.co/iIi0ZhK3jx

It amuses me watching people complain about the CDC recommendation that you not cheer if you are at a #SuperBowl party. 

You should not even be having a party where proper safety measures cannot be implemented. You must not have been paying attention during the holidays.

1. For the combined score to be above 56.

2. For the Bucs to beat the spread &amp; lose by 3 or less.

3. For the score to read Bucs 6, Chiefs 3 at the end of every quarter.

4. Good games certain players. Fan Duel and Draft Kings.

Thought: if he’s getting traded, it breaks between Monday and whenever the combine replacement is. Reasoning: the league would frown on anything competing with the Super Bowl.

Let’s play a scenario out quick.

You’re having a super bowl party and order 200 wings. You run out and someone says 200 wasn’t enough, you needed 300. Does that mean you need 300 more or 100 more?

The same goes for the stimulus check.

In the time of uncertainty that is COVID, it is good to know two constants remain - @TomBrady in the Super Bowl and @kylebelanger1 representing western Mass on radio row.
Goff took his team to a super bowl. Wentz lead his team there. All within a few years of being drafted 1 and 2 respectfully..... now they’re both traded. Yet Ben can’t seem to go somewhere else

My official #SuperBowl prediction:
#ChiefsKingdom 47, #GoBucs 28
I just don't see Tampa's undermanned defense slowing down Kansas City's offense, which is arguably the best in the #NFL.

@EJtheCROOM @The_Currency @TerrellChuggs Yup. Makes it murky. Eli Manning has 2 rings and Super Bowl MVPs and I don’t think any one would choose him over Brees or Rodgers, who both somehow only have 1 ring.
This Super Bowl Sunday, please celebrate responsibly. If you choose to drink, do not get behind the wheel and designate a Sober Driver.

Less than an hour before I get to get my new car after that asshole totaled mine a few weeks ago and two days from watching the goat go for #7 to help keep my Bucs undefeated in the super bowl #EliteWeekend🔥🔥🔥
And I can’t bet against Brady in the Super Bowl, that’s asinine.

If I had to guess I’d say Andy Reid has a play setup for a red zone no look td pass from Mahomes. Highlight touchdowns steal momentum in these type of games. I also think the Bucs are going to run the ball a lot and try to beat them by winning time of possession #SuperBowl

I bet this Super Bowl breaks every viewership record that exists. Not just because it’s Brady on a different team, but less people congregating at SB parties = game being played from more individual households/devices.

@AaronLemingNFL MAINLY? Yes. He has to WANT it. But the infrastructure is vital IMHO...I don’t think Tom Brady takes NWE or the Bears to Super Bowl 55, for example. So that’s what I mean. IND is in SB contention IMHO...the Bears? Not quite...plus I expect ARob-their best player on O to leave.

This is such a weird Super Bowl experience. Just thinking back to last year in Miami—seems unbelievable that it was a year ago and we were all living completely normal lives at that point.

Marketing hack: make your company an awesome/hilarious/memorable commercial and release it on YouTube with the title “[Brand/Company Name] Super Bowl [Year] Commercial” at the start of the third quarter.

People will see it. Saves you millions and gets you a national audience.

@HarrySax17 @Ant_Hems21 @PHLEaglesNation You saw a Super Bowl because of Wentz, and if you don’t see that, you are a bandwagon fan. You follow the majority opinion of fans. Wentz was having an MVP season before he got hurt, lead this team to home field advantage through the playoffs. Foles played 1 ok game, 2 great ones
@jagabalski @steelers @3williethadude9 I remember that too. We won our 5th Super Bowl  that day and Jerome Bettis retired after the game. That’s what really stands out for me.
SUPER BOWL SUNDAY @ JEFE’S
Well I guess I'm gonna be watching the Superbowl alone as well.  So who you got?  I'm going with the Kansas City Chiefs.
Carlsbad, New Mexico native and punter Dave Sherer won an NFL Championship in 1959 with the former Baltimore Colts alongside Johnny Unitas.
Remember, the first Super Bowl wasn’t played until 1967.
Some history since the Super Bowl is Sunday.
Former NMMI great Roger Staubach won two Super Bowls with the Dallas Cowboys in 1971 and 1977.
He isn’t the only former NMMI cadet to win an NFL title though.

Personally, I feel that Tom Brady has had all the glory.
He needs to STOP playing so that up and coming QB can show their stuff. 
REALLY @TOMBRADYHow many damn Super Bowl rings must you have ??
I was always a Pats fan. But it's not fair to other clubs to play Brady.
Looking for squares because the only way I’m watching this Super Bowl is if gambling is involved

I guess my hope for the super bowl is that tom brady gets knocked out early in the game, and the backup for TB wins the bucs the super bowl. that’s it. that’s the hope.
@altimesuspended Hes an upgrade regardless because Drew’s arm isnt the same anymore. However, ALOT has to go right to win the super bowl. And the most talented teams dont always win. He’ll do well here in New Orleans, but will the Saints as a TEAM do well enough to get over the hump?
Super Bowl 40 was 15 years ago today. What a day that was. Thought my whole life we’d never get that one for the thumb. Feel the same way about stairway to seven, but it will happen. And then more will happen.

@MalwareJake I’m just trying to figure out how we even made it to the Super Bowl with one of the worst defenses in the league
A year ago I was hiking in Hawaii, 4 years ago I was at a big Super Bowl party &amp; the Patriots won, 5 years ago I was horseback riding in Medellín, tonight I’m in my childhood bedroom wondering which k-drama to watch.........

@SeaTimesSports We need The Flash back! Or figure out who else we can acquire... Having a solid 3 option is how we won the Super Bowl... J.Kearse was that guy... We gotta find another stud in the draft or free agency or Josh Gordan gotta quarantine himself away from Marijuana lol 🤪😂🤣

Anybody got the hookup on Super Bowl parties
I shouldn't say this out loud. I would have loved to have seen Green Bay in the Super Bowl, but...I think KC would have had their way with the Packers.
Not watching the game...

✅ #GoBucs fans/gear EVERYWHERE 

✅ Drive-by “Tampa — Bay” chants &amp; car horns

✅ Overwhelming excitement about hosting #TampaBayLV

Let’s. Play. Football. https://t.co/YDbHObNdis
Some of these Super Bowl prop bets are downright ridiculous. 😆
2 more sleeps until Super Bowl Sunday!! 2 years in a row my team is in this game. Haven’t been as excited this week as I was last year but I’m starting to get anxious for game! Will pry be up early Sunday waiting!
I am more upset about not being able to find my veggie tray for Super Bowl Sunday than when I left my raybans on a golf course. It never got to live up to its veggie potential. #RIP

The Super Bowl doesn't matter right now.

Thoughts and prayers for those of you living in Iowa.

Biden voters - please stay home.

Trump Terrorists - hang out together for Super Bowl but don’t trust hospitals in the next two weeks. George Soros will have space lasers guarding the hospital doors.

The fact that I’m not throwing a Super Bowl party on Sunday is really bumming me out.
First story at @KDKA in the books! Are you staying home or going out for Super Bowl Sunday? https://t.co/N0ZTF9sFwY
I'm super excited about this upcoming Superbowl!! I love the Chiefs. Mahomes is going up against Brady again!  It's the ultimate grudge match.  No matter what the final score is, it's going to be an amazing display of football at its best. #Mahomeszonesweepstakes @adidasUS

It does seem serendipitous for the (hopefully only) home Super Bowl to happen the year home advantages are as attenuated as they can be. And the star of the home team spent two decades with a different home stadium, until just last year.

@Canadia73281089 @hitRECordJoe So... I don’t know how to say this to you, Destro, but Patrick Mahommes doesn’t play football. However, @PatrickMahomes does. So, you’re wrong and Patrick Mahommes won’t be winning the Super Bowl or being the MVP. @TomBrady will be doing both here in Tampa on Sunday! #SuperBowl
one more dumbass day of work separating me from 12 hours of super bowl binge drinking
I can’t lie, as I look around at Super Bowl teams of the last decade, doubts creep in about the strict draft-and-develop approach that’s been maintained at 1265 Lombardi Avenue during that time for me.

Give it a watch &amp; let me know if you've got a better underrated Super Bowl halftime show.
Does it have the production value &amp; star power of the #SuperBowl halftime shows we're used to these days, no of course not.
We've all got our favorite #SuperBowl  halftime shows like Lady Gaga, Beyoncé, Michael Jackson, Prince &amp; Diana Ross but if you haven't watched Super Bowl XXV halftime show you're missing something.

It's the most underrated halftime show of all time.
https://t.co/fu7plrCFn7
And yes I saw everyone of these. And have a ulcer from all the way too close and come from behind victory’s I didn’t know they had the super bowl if the #Patriots were not in it. But I guess the rule has changed to Brady is mandatorily in all Super Bowls #TB12 #TomBrady #GOAT https://t.co/CHlH5QN5vl
My prediction for the Super Bowl.

Titans win by 9, Tannehill is named MVP.

Brady and Belichick are both arrested.

If President Joe Biden, VP Kamala Harris can meet up with Colin Kaepernick so he can restore his Football career on Sunday or in the future.

Today @AaronRodgers12 will match @BrettFavre in last worthwhile accomplishment.... next season he’ll get that elusive second #Superbowl victory #gopackgo
As a @Chiefs fan, you gotta be thankful just to be back in another Super Bowl so quickly, win or lose!
Technically the act of "watching" the Super Bowl does not monetarily support the NFL.  Buying the advertised products supports the advertisers and networks.  So not watching the game but still buying Budweiser this weekend supports the NFL. So watch the game, record who the.
Can’t wait to watch @Chiefs win the Super Bowl tomorrow! ❤️🤘🏽
I’m not saying naming my Animal Crossing town Tampa Bay had anything to do with the Buccaneers making the super bowl, but I’m not NOT saying it.

I don’t even care who wins. This is a kinda cool Super Bowl. If Tom wins, he should retire with style. If Patrick wins, Tom should pass the torch and still retire. Tommy Boy, you’re the doggone king brother. This should be the final one and let the new gen run it https://t.co/pHyBQQKjiN

Hey. @IAGovernor Lifting covid restrictions on super bowl Sunday is a death sentence for many Iowans. We know you don’t give a shit about Iowa so do us all a favor and go out without a mask on.
Can you handle the heat?! Challenge yourself and your friends tomorrow for #SuperBowl Sunday with our hot wings plate ranging from mild buffalo to insanity sauce. (Available at Lavaca Street Bar at Rock Rose.) https://t.co/LGZNaD7jzU

For the 1988 super bowl against the bengals, I remember as a child watching and seeing Joe drive with little time to secure the title. I was in tears it was a joy. Coming home from church then watching my team win. I ran out screaming we won the title. https://t.co/U41d8KEKEu
@Hottest_TakePod @PFF @jsimms1119 Anything that can help our defense out. If we want 2compete&amp;go2 superbowl than we need 2build a great defense!

@MJNDesigner I’m not big into attacks but a lot of us this it’s weird that a large portion of the fan base thinks it’s impossible to win a Super Bowl with the 7th best QB in the league so the whole team needs blown up in hopes of someday maybe having the 6th best QB in the league. 🤷‍♂️

@SirHayofWood @djsoulsister They don’t want crowds OUTSIDE for Carnival Haywood, but you can party all you want for the Super Bowl wherever under phase 2 restrictions.  Please tell me the logic there. I fully expect a National spike in cases within two weeks.

Loading up on snacks and not leaving my apartment until Monday. 😅 I’m pretty much trapped because of #SuperBowl since all roads are closing at 5PM until Monday morning around me.
@CivilWarOTD @joe_mama_besser @TheMonValley @Miss_Bellatrix This is 100% true.  We’ve been blessed but I do remember sitting in the old stadium (which I miss badly) watching them lose by 40 to Miami or Denver.  The scary thing is they will be a Super Bowl contender again next year

@ClydeHaberman Feel better soon!  I've just had my first dose but am scared to death. My work colleagues wear chin masks and many plan big Super Bowl parties. And most refused the vaccine.
Got 2 big bets on the super bowl tomorrow... let’s hope my fav player ever TB12 helps me get this 💰
How good is Tom Brady? He just brought a mediocre coach (at best) to the Super Bowl.
I’m so caught up in Premier League football that I had zero idea that tomorrow is the Super Bowl 😅

I took an advertising class in college that I loved, and for the super bowl we had to analyze the commercials for a project. So now I especially focus on the super bowl commercials lol.
The Chiefs better freaking win the Super Bowl or I’m gonna lose it .

Tampa bay winning the super bowl
@Raudry09 Yeah no way that’s a good trade if that’s middle or early 1st rounders. Maybe, and I mean maybe if it’s two late rounders from a super bowl contender. He has potential if you look at years past tape. This last year was terrible though.
Patrick Mahomes vs. Tom Brady AND a  performance by a The Weeknd?? May be my favorite super bowl ever man
@SunCoastChief Was not in my morning brief either. Guess I'll do it at breakfast and during superbowl tomorrow.
I don’t think the NFL would be thrilled if the Eagles partly overshadowed the Super Bowl with a Carson Wentz deal. https://t.co/i8mam6APJM

@YnotGonzo You don’t be an mvp caliber qb go down for the season and your back up can win the Super Bowl still and get mvp lol. That ain’t happening with true great qbs I’m sorry.
@LarryE68 Chiefs are about to win a Super Bowl and go back to back. I’m not particularly concerned about college kids during a wacky Covid year. We had the team lined up last year to win the title and Covid washed away the tourney. This year was always gonna be a rebuild.
@YnotGonzo The one season in the super bowl system lol.

One of my patients has a GI bleed and is also from prison and asked me today to keep him at least until Monday because he wants to watch the Super Bowl and they don’t have televisions in prison.

@DoodlesTrks @janetshoemake @roosterpisces @Marizellell @azredhen @yrwol7 @WmScottBlair @JakeHolman57 @ClarkKe95563197 @31BJN Watch out for the crazy drivers. If you travel tomorrow night beware of crazy mad drivers who lost money 💵 on the Super Bowl.
@jzulgad If they did make it back to the Super Bowl and ended up losing again, I don’t know if my heart could take it.  Obviously I want to see them bring a Lombardi home someday, but I can’t help but be pessimistic when it comes to the success rate of Minnesota sports teams.

@BlueJacketsNHL is there a game tomorrow considering it’s Super Bowl?
@Charlie5480 @Chiefs No lo se Rick... si los Chiefs ganan seran el primer equipo en hacer un doble campeonato y si gana Brady sera por mas el mejor de todos los tiempos. 
Los dos no son de mi agradado, pero prefiero a Brady 🤷🏽‍♂️ #SuperBowl #Buccaneers

@TomBrady and @PatrickMahomes are just so dope to me this is really a special #SuperBowl https://t.co/Im0nyQxE80
@AO350legend Yeah also the inside area with team lockers, rings, PFHOF, etc. had massive lines.

Panini booth with photo is a decent opportunity if not big line. Also just above that is a huge #SuperBowl frame.

Hixon Park has mostly entertainment/food trucks - Ashley Home has free #SBLV swag
Chili. That’s a great idea. I will now make chili tomorrow. 

Also he’s right. Don’t attend or throw a #SuperBowl party this year. https://t.co/IG6B0dkg8L

@HonestBn They usually run it the week before the 500. I figure with the Super Bowl being this week it caused the to change. Probably has to do with trying to condense the time at the tracks also. It will be run on the Daytona road course.

Super Bowl should be played on Saturday. Sunday, if there’s a holiday on Monday.
Why is the Super Bowl so late on Sunday?  It should be on Saturday... but if it had to be Sunday, why so late in the day?

@ThatChristinaG @JuiceboxCA I avoid the previews so I can be surprised by the ads during the show. An artifact from growing up without previews of Super Bowl ads⁉️
The college basketball game is over and the @CBS 2 News at 6pm is starting right now with Ms. @JessicaMooreTV anchoring with the day's top stories and the forecast. More snow on the say for Super Bowl Sunday in which you can watch the game only on CBS2❄️📺🏈. @CBSNewYork https://t.co/faBi1CVDrw

@4DropsOfJupiter I watch for the commercials lol every Superbowl Sunday it's always been about the commercials bc my teams didn't always make it to the Superbowl. Plus I am more college ball over pro ball. #SuperbowlCommercialsAreSuperior
I’m actually going to a Super Bowl party tomorrow.. who am I
This time tomorrow I’ll be at the super bowl 😁
@coach_bald @SuperBowl @TomBrady @TampaBucccaneer @PatrickMahomes @Chiefs @PlayBookAthlete @NFL No, not going to the Super Bowl.
@doyled4 @Ace9514 @JJLahey @skoltanishka @RobDemovsky @DotsNCuts Exactly^ why should Packers fans just be “happy” that we do well every year, but then never make it to the SuperBowl? The point isn’t to play a “good” season. It’s to get to the SB and win, and the Packers haven’t hired or drafted anyone who will help us get there in 10 years.
@coach_bald @SuperBowl @TomBrady @TampaBucccaneer @PatrickMahomes @Chiefs @PlayBookAthlete @NFL Are those all yours?😮

@marcuscleary4 @GBPdaily @RobDemovsky As @packers HC, MFL took the team to 2 NFC Championship games in first 2 years. The natural progression  is that he will take the team to next Super Bowl. If not, he should let go. Young, good looking, &amp; new ideas coaches don't mean Super Bowl. Just look at 2 coaches of this SB.

@BazzDaGuru Half these games bro defense didn’t show up either can’t have a Shootout without a full roster either. All I’m saying is give him a chance to prove himself with the new staff and if he ain’t clicking trade him by the trade deadline. Without him we don’t have a super bowl

I like the Super bowl parties in the eighties when everyone brought food, we had a keg, shots, played ping pong and the music was so loud we couldn't hear the neighbors knocking on the door to complain.

They really scheduled me 3-cl on super bowl day LMAOO
@BrentBiles @NFLonFOX The league needs some parity but it aint gonna happen. Because the game is always a ratings boost no matter who is in it. It is odd that 12 of 30 teams have never won a Superbowl. Since most of them are AFC teams (7 of 12) dont expect KC to be challenged anytime soon.

I just finished drawing a #SuperBowl tribute sketch which I posted few seconds ago. I’m getting ready for #SuperBowlSunday tomorrow. My grandmother’s picking me up from my house so I can spend the night and get ready to watch the game with my grandparents.

In case you’re wondering...here’s my #SuperBowl prediction:

@Buccaneers 34
@Chiefs 31

It is unbelievable that #TomBrady will be playing in his 10th Super Bowl. Amazing! I pulling for him to get ring #7! 🏈🏈🏈 (Don’t tell Luke. He likes #PatrickMahomes.)
@SEMichigan_Wx Now tell us oh great guru…what of Sunday night/Monday?  Any chance of any inclement weather to call off post-Super Bowl Monday! 🙏🏼🙏🏼🤡

@KAIHOTTIES I can’t wait until the Súper bowl is over so I can know peace breh. I don’t gaf about this game and I still don’t. The most I ever did was when Atlanta went and that was still mild interest.
Events that over shadow my bday in February: Groundhog Day, Super Bowl, black history month, Valentine’s Day, Presidents’ Day, occasionally the leap year *sigh*

Looks like my Super Bowl party will have to be canceled because nobody is on board for wearing dental dams during the requisite halftime make-out session.
@onlyinfresnoart I’ve seen so many tweets about it, blows my mind. If he was the niners QB we would have won the Super Bowl last year😂 like the man beat mahomes on the road and they really think it’s not the defense LOL
It's been weird being so far away from KC during the run-up to this Super Bowl. 
I miss the atmosphere around town. 
Those of you in KC, what's it been like this time around?
How does it compare to last year?
Budweiser’s super bowl ad definitely involved a dog who gets put up for adoption after it’s owner dies of covid, and finds a new home with a kind family that loves beer and social distancing

This is the first time I've been away since Miami #SuperBowl Week - mental health was just as much of a factor as being safe.
@JusJay713 2017 was legit but Foles won the Super Bowl MVP, so obviously they team was legit and not just Wentz carrying them

The NFL has several covid safety measures in place at Raymond James Stadium for the game, including giving the limited number of fans masks. 

NFL Chief Medical Officer says mask wearing is “probably the most important risk mitigation strategy.”
https://t.co/zXEWdP2Avz #SBLV
The crowds gathered in downtown Tampa on the eve of Super Bowl LV. 

City put in place a mask ordinance ahead of #SBLV events but compliance here is at best guess maybe around 50%.

Because of forecasted snow (thank you local meteorologists) &amp; wanting to see super bowl I will now head back tomorrow afternoon. Pizzas for lunch. Left overs for dinner.
Don’t mean to be judging but... I can empathize with those who went away over Xmas break needing sun or change of scenery (not saying that’s okay- but I get it). Going to a super bowl party?? Don’t get it at all.

52 years and still to this day, the only quarterback ever to wear the NY Jets uniform in a Super Bowl. Mind boggling. #Jets #SuperBowl  @RealJoeNamath https://t.co/qPZ1SWbzEJ

Obviously, this is on my bucket list. Last year, I was able to enjoy the AFC Champ game with my sons..@GrizzleChase @ZaneGrizzle (@grizzle_trent in spirit).  One day, I want the 4 of us to go to a Super Bowl with either the @dallascowboys or @Chiefs So looking forward 2 tomorrow https://t.co/LzOn19HLkz
@Frank_The_K Now to need to figure out what other bets I wanna make for the Super Bowl. I got $70 to use on my BetMGM account.
not watching the super bowl w/ @Andrew_Zimmel  this year..... So I might as well just cry
I love the Packers but I hate the fans. They are so terrible. Always so negative. Which is why I haven't been as invested in them as I use to. Too much energy in negativity. So with that Welcome to the new DC. I hope good things come and we get back to Superbowl!
Go Bruce get your Super Bowl win. From everyone in AZ https://t.co/bY51xasyQa

@5ReasonsSports That is probably what you will get.  They’ll justify the Super Bowl win  and post season success as the tie breaker.  They are both seen as borderline, so they will not let them both in on the same ballet.  I really feel bad for him.
@PlayingPolitics I’m watching alone. No super bowl parties here.
@JarettVs I hate Tom Brady &amp; the Denver Broncos deflated footballs. I think the Falcons were cheated in the Superbowl. In Georgia we've had all kinds of cheating going on here even now with Kemp &amp; Republicans. Makes me wonder if Republicans has helped Tom Brady.
@GeorgePapa19 At least you won a super bowl in your life time,I've been a lions fan since I was a kid, the first QB we've had in 30 years that was pretty good and they traded him.

Hate to say it, because I'm an Eagles fan, but the Super Bowl win was a fluke. The entire team, including the starting QB, was injured but the healthy guys stepped up and the coaches did a fantastic job with what they had. The GM, as often happens, got too much credit. https://t.co/EoldpaRILR
@GavinNewsom Let’s keep improving and stay home for Super Bowl #SuperBowl btw Chiefs will win
Should I bet that my guy Scotty Miller scores 3 touchdowns in the Super Bowl 🤔😂 probably not, but I will anyway
My partner is plagued by more frequent migraines since he had Covid &amp; since we're socially distanced I can't be w/ him to help or comfort him. 

Stay home. Mask up.

If you are on the fence about going to a Superbowl party tomorrow, invent an excuse if you need to, but stay home.
The house parties in my area are so loud that I can hear it through the walls of my house.
I hate Super Bowl Weekend.

@grapejuicepix @NatalieEgenolf Nobody should expect Foles to be coming in to win a Super Bowl though and if they do then they don’t know anything about football. No way they’d bring Foles in if they traded Hurts/kept Wentz. I’m sure the Eagles would make it clear to he wasn’t being brought in to start.
@AaronRodgers12 Bruhhhhh we suppose to be in the super bowl!!! Run that shit in next season 😭😭😫😭

Meanwhile, Dick Vitale was using that entire second half as a countdown to the Super Bowl.

Honestly, didn’t care much about who won before tonight. Now I kinda hope the Bucs get blasted out of their own stadium.

@TheB34st13 @BleacherReport Hmm... seeing as how Manning owns a 3-2 playoff record vs. Brady, 2-1 in AFC title games (Brady’s last win in the playoffs over Peyton was during the first George W. Bush administration), and Peyton’s brother beat Brady twice in the Super Bowl; I think it’s the other way around.

Peyton is a year older than Tom, just inducted into the Hall. Meanwhile Tom is getting ready for his 10th Super Bowl tomorrow 🤣🤣🤣
Your QB never took four different head coaches to the Super Bowl. #PeytonManning #ColtsNation
BBQ and Super Bowl like a vibe tomorrow 😎 #SuperBowlWeeknd #SuperBowl
Rodgers won the mvp? That’s cute... Tommy Boy beat his fucking ass and is playing in the Super Bowl tomorrow so
I don’t even know who’s playing in the Super Bowl, I’ll just be drunk and cute tomorrow.
@_PeteSmith_ For 1 year when your best players are either cheap or on rookie contracts, yes. He hopefully stays healthy and is a big part of a Super Bowl run. He is a stud.

-Time it takes from now until my dad calls me to gloat about Kuz’s game tonight (-120)

Super Bowl Sunday haha we are thinking Supercross Sunday lol
No Steel Curtain, no #SuperBowl secondary (Blount, Shell, Edwards, etc), WRs (Stallworth, Shanklin, etc.). Brilliant man...#PFHOF long overdue. https://t.co/NynYDaQ4Jl
@SavageBoston The super bowl is more of a team effort tho.
Super Bowl festivities are up to a ratchet start I see. Y’all stay safe! 😬 https://t.co/dzbaGW6Npv
Mahomes played sooo bad during the super bowl last year lol
Just gotta say:

Despite all the craziness of the @SuperBowl in @CityofTampa — and tons of people cheering on the @Buccaneers — Pedro at @jwmarriotttampa is really redefining service, attentiveness, and hospitality.

Kudos, team!

Final Super Bowl prediction (unless a mindblowing injury happens, doubt it):

Buccaneers 32, Chiefs 28

Predicting that everything that I DO NOT want to happen, unfortunately WILL happen. This includes another Tom Brady comeback. 

And if I'm wrong, I really won't feel too bad.

I like #SNL's take on how the Super Bowl TV ads will try to address everything in the last year, but I am sure that the actual ads will be funnier, at least unintentionally.
This was a superbowl joke i feel like ppl are missing that?
The #Buccaneers hadn’t made the playoffs since 2007.

They sign Tom Brady and now, not only are they in the playoffs, but in the Super Bowl.

I understand COVID has taken away most of the Super Bowl media, but even so, this should be a bigger storyline

@DickAndSauce @SuperBowl Also I already told Calvin I’d pull for his Bucs. He’s been praying for rain for a week to take away KC speedsters advantage lol
@DickAndSauce @SuperBowl I am thinking the same thing. Their game in the regular season started the @Chiefs way, then it was ALL @Buccaneers late. Great game. I expect it to be close

So I have a theory who ever had the most impact commercial their stocks are going to go up crazy, also with more Americans at home due to Rona  the Super Bowl is probably going to have the highest amount of people watching tomorrow, power change.
Idk what's more confusing Mets fans now acting like they never wanted Trevor Bauer and calling him a bum or The fans of teams in the AFC East rooting for Tom Brady to win again. #Mets #Jets #Bills #Patriots #Dolphins #SuperBowl

Tampa got a tornado warning going on, are we even having a super bowl? Do it in Vegas forever, we have a roof and better food.
Wow congrats to Tony Romo for finally knowing what being at the Super Bowl is like tomorrow 🥳
ITS OFFICIALLY #SuperBowl  SUNDAY
@NFL @Buccaneers I think it’s wonderful that you invited medical people to watch the super bowl. They deserve it but not one EMT/medic invited? You know better then most what a team effort fighting covid was. We were left off the team. @NYCEMSwatch @Send_Paramedics @UEMSO_FDNY
Toughness links the this years Super Bowl QBs:  “This is the separator,” according to NFL head coach Kliff Kingsbury, a former teammate of Brady and coach of Mahomes.

Up at 530 on super bowl Sunday. Shitttt this might be the year I don’t even make it to kickoff
@sheley_justin @funkc24 I originally “butted in” because someone called Marino “the greatest QB not to play in a super bowl” which isn’t true because he DID play in one, and that KC had the chance to draft him, I just pointed out he fell so far that everyone had a chance. Miami didn’t even need a QB
Super Bowl Sunday

🚫 No stream Sunday &amp; Monday.

Taking Sunday, as well as Monday off from streaming to not only watch the superbowl but also to recover for the next week of streams. Definitely going to be on Destiny a lot due to Season of the Chosen! Anyways, just wanted to let you all know. 🖤
Looks like the “snowstorm”

@mekosoff That’s one thing that troubles me about the whole Super Bowl “wardrobe malfunction” incident. Janet Jackson (the woman) was in the wrong. To hear people talk about it now, you would never know Justin Timberlake was involved if you didn’t watch the actual video.
So there will be cardboard cutouts of people at #SuperBowl. Will there be a cutout of @BernieSanders from the inauguration? If not, can there be one? Sitting in the end zone, just waiting. #SuperBowl2021

I got KC 38 TB 24. The KC offense proves to be too much going down the stretch. #SuperBowl
Do I just misunderstand what Most Valuable Player means? One guy takes his team to 12-4 in 2019, leaves and they go 7-9 and miss the playoffs without him. The team he goes to moves from 7-9 in 2019 to 11-5 and are in the Super Bowl. How is that not clearly “valuable”?

According to the “Super Bowl Indicator,” a win for the AFC team foretells a decline in the stock market and a win for the NFC team means the market will rise in the coming year. 

Now last year — despite that dramatic drop early in the pandemic — the market ended being up 15.7%.

Woke at 2am. Listened to a sermon on prayer by @hbcharlesjr. Laid awake the rest of the night meditating and praying about what I heard. I’ll be tired &amp; will be snoozing through the #SuperBowl, but it was so worth it.

@DragonflyJonez It’s not as good but I like maurkice pouncey. Played HS and college with his twin brother on the same o line. 3 HS state titles. Natty. 9 Pro bowl appearances. Super bowl champ. I think getting to play along side your twin brother for 4 titles (3 HS 1 NCAA) has to be pretty cool.
Super bowl Sunday!

Happy Super Bowl Sunday #Jets fans!

Joe Namath and Friends made sure the Jets have at least 1 Super Bowl win (12 teams have 0). 

Which other Jets team did you reaaaally think was destined to win?

Super Bowl Sunday!!
How many people am I gonna lose respect for today because they host or attend Super Bowl watch parties as if we're not a year into a global pandemic?

Genuinely nervous about learning how selfish people I thought I liked actually are.

C'mon guys we've had enough to deal with this year!
Any super bowl parties in Tampa? 👀
You know how mayors and governors often have friendly Super Bowl bets?  My kids’ high school is a stone’s throw from @Buccaneers HQ and @RJStadium and they’ve entered into a friendly wager with KC’s equivalent school.
 The winner:
 a charity in the winning team’s city.  Go Bucs! https://t.co/FsprvW9znb

Can we all just agree that Whitney Houston absolutely crushed the National Anthem and raised the America’s Spirit like no one ever has before? That’s what I’m hoping for tonight. A Whitney type performance. We are in need of that and an epic Super Bowl to follow.

Who r u rooting for today? https://t.co/akLfrjHxHx
When the Browns win the Super Bowl, it will be the greatest title in the history of professional sports and it won’t be remotely close.
Happy Super Sunday yall. 
Enjoy with friends &amp; family.

@TheRaulNavedo I figured as much. Playing the SB in your home stadium is history making. Plus Tampa set records anyway, going to the Stanley Cup, World Series, and Super Bowl in the same year/season. Pretty cool!
Day 38 of 365—today is just another day...don’t let the Super Bowl hype trick you back into that old self destructive behavior.

@ProbablyChantel @packersglobal1 @Bobo10166061 @thecheckdown @AaronRodgers12 @packers A lot has to align to make it to the super bowl. The Packers are the only consistent NFC team to make it this close year in and year out. Every NFC champion since 2014 has not even made it back to at least a championship game let alone the Super Bowl.
am i the only one who forgot (and kinda doesn’t care) that it’s super bowl sunday?

My prediction for today is in remembrance of the greatest Super Bowl game ever is 34:28 @Buccaneers win. It will look rough at first but then the comeback king will show up and sweep it and history will be made! #sundayvibes
Every time I’ve been in the car this week, Crazy Train has come on.

@thekaceykasem @mcbreeze11 Nice! Super Bowl birthday would be great! Have a good one!
@cody_merrow If my math is correct, the last time there was a Super Bowl without a QB connected to the Patriots (Brady, Garoppolo, Newton) @AnikFlorianPod wasn’t even born yet #Analysis

@yulimelih You know those sets of bowls that are used for baking? 

Well, the largest one is the super bowl
@JennyDickson222 That sounds good too! I’m just hoping this is a little more relaxing than last years Super Bowl 🤞🏻
Love Mahomes, but I love #TomBrady more. #SuperBowl https://t.co/qOJcypL9j6
TAMPA, Fla. (NEXSTAR) — As officials in Florida warned the Super Bowl had the potential to be a super-spreader event if people didn’t practice proper pandemic protocols, thousands crowded the streets of the Ybor City neighborhood on Saturday night. https://t.co/DnZMmyUXys
Tonight is the night Super Bowl is here defending champions @Chiefs will be facing the NFC South champions @Buccaneers who will won tonight on CBS post your score prediction in the comments down below
So many things about this last year have been different. @PaniniAmerica cards of @TomBrady &amp; @RobGronkowski in @Buccaneers uniforms reinforce it. At the same time so many things are the same. Brady back for his 10th #SuperBowl &amp; I’ve been blessed to see them all. 😷 #colorblast https://t.co/lZ4zGah01t

Who do you have on this grandiose Super Bowl sunday? The Goat Brady or baby Goat Mahomes?? I think it’s going to be an epic battle regardless #SuperBowl #SBLV
Once again, Tampa just can’t keep it’s shit together. IT IS A FUCKING PANDEMIC. @CityofTampa should have not let this happen. Sigh... #Tampa, I’m not mad. I’m disappointed. And if the @Buccaneers win the #SuperBowl, please stay the fuck home to celebrate. Please. https://t.co/VonJJfAIcu

Don't say you want masc if you don't intend to partake today!

@mistergeezy @jtimberlake He ripped off Janet’s top at the superbowl, we all saw it. We just couldn’t believe what we saw and most of the heat focused on Janet. https://t.co/Y5Nydn3YQ0

Hey @NFL.  2 things
1. #SuperBowl on a Saturday would be amazing. When we get back to social gatherings, knowing Monday morning being a work day is rough. 
2. Start game earlier. If you want the sport to continue to grow in Europe starting at 11pm-12am doesn’t help. #NFL #NFLUK

On this #SuperBowl morning let us acknowledge a couple things...

📍A ⭐️ rating isn’t your DNA. Competition, grind &amp; resiliency make a whole lot possible.

📍The Bielema ⭐️ rating tweet is more flawed than a soup sandwich.

Super Bowl prediction time. Mahomes feels the heat from the Tampa pass rush, but he is able to avoid some of the pressure and make big plays by scrambling and throwing on the run. The #Chiefs pass defense, which is very good, will be the difference in the game. KC 34 Tampa Bay 20
Today there will be 3 bombers doing the flyover at the Super Bowl: a B1, B2 and a B-52. Adding up to 55 for the 55th SB.

@BPinAZ1975 @BrianWunsch @AndyHermanNFL I will say this with some optimism, we made this last one a game. At the half I thought it was 2016 and 2019 all over again. Hated being out of the game that early, would love to have that feeling of we kicked so much ass that by half we knew we were super bowl bound.

The #Patriots used to hold their training camps at my alma mater - Bryant University. I shared a field with Tom Brady each fall from 2000-2003. After which, I started my career with ESPN. I’m in my 18th year with the worldwide leader. Brady is still playing in the NFL #SuperBowl https://t.co/yUOGOSf0Wi
@kelly_j_baker Yep.
The SNL skit from last night about this for the Super Bowl = gold.

It is exhausting being the NO family, however, I also actually sleep at night knowing we aren’t scanning for symptoms nonstop.
I should be watching my @Saints in the #SuperBowl today 😪
I forgot the Super Bowl was today lololol

As someone who actually enjoys watching the game, Super Bowl parties suck anyway and will not be missed by me.
The First AFL-NFL World Championship Game(Super Bowl I) 1/15/1967(54 years ago) at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in Los Angeles, California.

@AlbertsonB2 Our sons who have never been big sports fans wanted to watch the Super Bowl from about that age on. Probably because the Colts were in the Super Bowl in 2007 &amp; 2010.

My only Superbowl bet, and it's a prop:

Tom Brady to throw an interception. It is juiced at -160, but it is the only one I really liked

I do not care about the Super Bowl in the slightest. 
The blatant racism and plantation atmosphere for rich Black men have taken its toll on my psyche. 
I can’t even think about my hometown Bears anymore without thinking about Colin Kaepernick. 

You suck, @NFL. #fixtheracismnow
I literally have no idea who’s playing in the super bowl and couldn’t care less
@mjparadis You: “I can’t believe Tom Brady is going back to another super bowl”

@catturd2 Won't be watching, but last great preference was U2, when they honored the 9/11 victims. I saw them in concert right after 9/11 in Nov or Dec at Kemper in KCMO. They honored the victims also.
Great watch on YouTube Super Bowl halftime preferences
It’s Super Bowl Sunday! Love the @TomBrady story and winning one outside of NE would be incredible. However I do like the Chiefs, they have transformed offense in the NFL! Plus @cheetah is a former @CowboyFB. If I have to choose, make it 7 for the 🐐! #WhoUgot #SuperBowl
It’s honestly still unbelievable to me that @TomBrady is playing in his 10th Super Bowl tonight
Can’t wait to watch the Super Bowl for the commercials 🤩 @disneyplus
@FalldownStream @HuntShowdown If you need a sidekick for sod let me know. I’m not a super bowl watcher. And I’ll be hanging all day.
People bitch and cry at other championship sporting events but not to the extent of the Super Bowl...ESPECIALLY if Tom Brady is in it

thats actually not ok, I think🙄
the nfl cannot make a statement about women coaches/refs in the super bowl and say they’re “breaking barriers” when they consistently let off domestic abusers with a slap on the wrist.
Happy super bowl Sunday! Love me some Patrick Mahomes♡ though gotta give credit to Brady for all he's done in one season. Enjoy the game, friends!

Aren’t conferences a major part of the #SuperBowl ? The field design ditching the AFC and NFC end zone logos a few years back takes away from this fact. It’s the AFC Champs vs. the NFC Champs, right? I’m a stickler for this and don’t know why!
I’m headed to the store at noon on Super Bowl Sunday.  Wish me luck.

Whitney Houston flashback in #SuperBowl programming, “I Have Nothing,” and her version of the #NationalAnthem in 1991...👏🏽
BECAUSE I WANT TO SEE AMANDA GORMAN BLESS THE WORLD WITH HER WORDS AND BEAUTY NOT ONLY WITH HER APPEARANCE BUT HER BEHAVIOR AND WORDS AND ACTIONS, TO BE HONEST I DONT EVEN KNOW THE TEAMS THAT ARE PLAYING OR ANYTHING ELSE ABOUT THE SUPERBOWL OTHER THAN  AMANDA GORMAN WILL BE
I will be going live anytime after 6:30 p.m. - 8:30 pm which could possible interrupt the SUPERBOWL AND/OR DURING THE TIME OF THE SUPERBOWL WHICH IS A GOOD TIME TO INTRODUCE MYSELF SO WE WILL SEE THAT WHICH GOD HAS PLANNED BUT NOW THAT I KNOW THE TIME I WILL BE WATCHING IS
They should just use the Whitney anthem on tape for every Super Bowl. It cannot be improved on.

#SuperBowl Prediction:

#GoBucs 31

It’ll be a very close, entertaining and high scoring game but I’m not betting against Brady, last time I did that I lost money 😂 but I think the Bucs will dominate the LOS and that’s what changes games #Mahomes #Brady

Rooting for @Buccaneers simply to avoid the inevitable sports media crowning of KC as a “dynasty” if they win. 3 titles = entry level dynasty. 
Even in cap era.  Nobody called the late 90’s Broncos a dynasty...early 2000’s Pats had to beat Philly before they were one. #SuperBowl

I'm so tired of hearing about Tom Brady. Yes he is good and yes he has made it to the superbowl again. However,  #PatrickMahomes is also in the superbowl......for the second year in a row......how about some coverage about him too @CBSSports
I’m taking bets for the Super Bowl...... i got KANSAS 😤 what’s up?! 🤑👀
I honestly could not care less about this Super Bowl, but you will see me at a party for the food✌🏼
Tony Romo finally made it to the Super Bowl
Don’t know what I did to deserve @MileyCyrus covering so many of my faves over the last yea and today, but def needed this performance at the Super Bowl. #kindredsoul 🌻👑🪢 https://t.co/bLiwwM8HyU

What is The Weeknd? Apparently they’re performing at the Super Bowl. Isn’t that reserved for well known musicians or bands that play real music? Probably just throw on a lil Morgan Wallen just to drown out that garbage of a halftime show.
There is only one athlete in this whole world that I just don’t like. And he’s about to rub his 10th Super Bowl appearance in my face. Hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.
Today Tom Brady will be playing in the Super Bowl *19 years* after his first one. What QBs come next after Brady for Super Bowl longevity?

I think of John Elway (12 years in between first and last), Peyton Manning (9) and Joe Montana (8). Who else would be on the list?
Ready for the Super Bowl! They might be in Tampa, but this is New England!! #superbowl #bostonforever @ Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts https://t.co/tAFCfs2rBh

Tom Brady’s ‘Go To The Super Bowl’ percentage on a yearly basis (47.6%)
is higher than Steph Curry’s all-time

Tom Brady is more likely to go to the Super Bowl on a yearly basis than Steph Curry is of hitting a 3 pointer. https://t.co/eRXKSowWt7

Not only is it pretty amazing that we get to have a Super Bowl this year, (especially when we didn’t know if we’d even have football this year), but we get to see a Super Bowl with two of the greatest QB’s of all time. Wow. What a time to be alive.
Although it pains me to see one of these teams playing &amp; not another...I’m still excited for a great game! #SuperBowl

I think fournette goes off today. And this game all falls on Tampa’s Defense. How many points you gonna let The chiefs score, and feel comfortable with Brady being able to match plus 3? That’s how it’s going down. #SuperBowl
I don’t know that I’ve ever cared less on Super Bowl Sunday. Or any game. I don’t know that I really care about anything right now.
I fucking love Super Bowl Sunday
Here are my #SuperBowl bold predictions.
1. Playoff Sammy will score at least 1 TD
2. Tyrann Mathieu will pick TB12 off in the 4th quarter
3. Mahomes will throw for 400+
4. Chiefs will score 40+ points
5. Chiefs will win by 2 scores

Time to watch the @SuperBowl looking forward to the commercials per usual and curious how the halftime show will go during this weird time. Also, I feel this will be a great and close game as both of the best QBs will be playing against each other.
Thank you, #AliciaKeys. Beautiful and moving moment at #SuperBowl #LiftEveryVoiceandSing
My official #SuperBowl prediction: 
#Buccaneers 28
#Chiefs 24

Not that want TB to win, but hey let’s face it. @TomBrady is the LOAT, luckiest of all time. He’ll get help from his defense once again or a cheap call from the zebras...We know how this works...

Enjoy the game 🍻
I only look forward to the #SuperBowl for the party platters and food 🏉🥳🤪
The #chiefs are the favorite in this game and are the defending champions, but the media makes it seem like KC has no chance. Pregame question "How are the chiefs and Mahomes going to handle the big stage"?

Loved #BLM moment with #LiftEveryVoiceandSing on @NFL super bowl
Another super bowl, another year of waiting to see if Tom Brady kisses anyone on the mouth. Maybe we’ll get one through a mask? Who knows. Can’t wait to watch! Go football!
Let’s go ! #SuperBowl https://t.co/buUoAOi7mX
First to 35 points wins, and I think #KCChiefs got it. #SuperBowl
Call me crazy cause I love football but this is me this year. Not the game, the commercials, or the entertainment. Guess it would help if a team I actually liked was playing in it! 😂 #SuperBowl https://t.co/IcTZhtTehr
Super bowl ready 🤝
Me and my daughter just annual football 🏈 catch and now it is time for #SuperBowl plus beer 🍺 lots beer 🍻
I’m having a little #SuperBowl shindig. But it’s okay, two of the guests are nurses. If anyone gets Covid, they’ll know what to do.
I feel like the #NFL is doing everything it can during THIS #SuperBowl except apologize to #ColinKaepernick. I appreciate the scheduled programming &amp; aspired commitment after years of lip-service (progress yes; but wow... the pushback over taking a knee as a symbol of protest) https://t.co/1D7w3VxilV
I’m placing my bet on #Buccaneers  #NFL #SuperBowl
Go Chiefs! #SuperBowl
While the @nfl pats itself on the back for being all about messages of unity, the @Chiefs take the field. This is the actual definition of irony I believe. #NotYourMascot #changethename #SuperBowl
First time since 2013 not being in the newsroom on Super Bowl Sunday. Wishing I were there. WFH is the worst. 😫
Excited to be spending Superbowl 55 with @RobStopablee ❤️. Drinking @BlueMoonBrewCo and eating @sophiaspizza 🍕🍻
@aliciakeys great rendition of the Black National Anthem. Perfect person to do it before the Superbowl!
My first Super Bowl in 4 years that I don’t have to work 🥲🙌🏽

Alicia Keyes singing the black national anthem Lift Every Voice pre game super bowl was POWERFUL and brought tears to my eyes, including those who were standing behind her wearing the names of those who were killed unjustly by police while unarmed ..
My theory about this Super Bowl is since Alabama won the Natty, Tommy Boy is going to get no. 7 #ChangeMyMind
Not me blacking out before kick off #SuperBowl
They have inserted ads literally everywhere this year #SuperBowl
2 straight years we've missed out on the State Farm Bowl. How could the NFL not want that? #SuperBowl https://t.co/QEd3WwdSvt
Who’s winning the Super Bowl?
All is #pregame talk reminds me of #SNL we’re going to run the ball pass the ball and when the other team gets the ball try and take the ball from them. #SuperBowl

He called the store and the lady at the store told him that I had to give them cash, even though I had already paid. I said I couldn’t and she told him to leave with the pizza and he did. Worst @pizzahutdeliver experience ever. #pizzahut #SuperBowl

As a guy also dealing with a brutal toe injury, I sympathize with Patrick Mahomes. Only difference between me and him is he’s playing in the super bowl and I just housed an entire pizza by myself
So is @theweeknd going to do the #TikTok dance during the #PepsiHalftime show? #SuperBowl

#SuperBowl Sunday Here We Come
@jeffselph4 @jd_abell I’m so old I remember watching the Super Bowl on a Sunday afternoon and then going to Sunday Night church.
Maybe packing the stadium with Cardboard cutouts wasn’t the best idea lmaooo #SuperBowl
Not a fan of Tony doing the super bowl, but guess he finally made it. But still not a playoff win #SuperBowl
With a team now having played the #SuperBowl in its home stadium, the only weird historic milestone left is for every team in the league to finish 8-8 in the same season.
Amanda Gorman’s poem honoring the 3 #SuperBowl Captains took my breath away. ✨✨✨ https://t.co/E3sKNyV6eP

bro if the chiefs win the super bowl, I just realized that boy Clyde Edwards-Helaire finna be too too lit he just won the national championship in college
Keys to beating Tom Brady, kill the clock #SuperBowl
2013 Super Bowl: “Who do you think will be the first ad out of the break? Gotta be Budweiser or FedEx right?”

2021 Super Bowl: all ads are just for movies that will stream on your phone now because theaters don’t exist anymore and brands are afraid of messing up.

What a fun weekend might not be watching the super bowl but it was worth it
There are so many things I shouldn’t like about football: misogyny, violence, etc, but I’ve been a fan as long as I can remember😬 It’s our first year EVER with no friends over while watching a stadium with WAY too many people. Sigh #SuperBowl #COVID19 https://t.co/g8Lmv4EmfF
"If 100 yrs old in New Mexico U don't pay state taxes" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 How much income U generating at 100. Who working 8hrs a day 40 a week at 100yrs old 🤣🤣🤣 Ya'll gotta do better @turbotax #SuperBowl

I haven’t seen a good super bowl commercial since like 2013
I want a big face hoodie. #tide 

#SuperBowl @HITS106KQKY
@mr_Turner_EdD Too many possibilities. You gotta go for what makes sense. You only take those kinds of chances unless you have no other choice. This is the Super Bowl. Every down counts.
@Rosie_Anderson_ The best super bowl commercial
These are the shittiest Super Bowl ads I have ever seen
Gronk is going off so the @CigarCityBeer Florida Man seemed appropriate.  #Superbowl https://t.co/z66wTgZfWt
My favorite non Super Bowl ad - Tom Brady &amp; Rob Gronkowski | Big Game Ad | #TheGOATin5G | T-Mobile https://t.co/CoBR3jB0bF via @YouTube
@IJasonAlexander hoody may be the best #SuperBowl commercials yet! @tide
Gronk wearing a mask while scoring Super Bowl touchdowns is the best ever "fuck you" both to COVID and mask haters.

@Victoria_Noe Super Bowl III was a classic. Also, the last time my Jets won. Unfortunately, I was not yet 6 months old so my memory is fuzzy.

Literally thousands of restaurants were forced to close this year because they forgot to sell you a hotdog with your beer but at the super bowl it’s business as usual. If you want a job where literally no rules ever apply to you, work for the NFL or the US Government tbh.
I’m about to play a rerun of one of Trumps MAGA Rallies at this Super Bowl party.
Finding out it’s Super Bowl weekend is my version of little seummwr boy.  Found out yesterday when coworkers brought it up.

Super bowl commercials are so lame this year
Oh @turbotax!  @SuperBowl ads are so bad.  Push back on your agency.
Travis Kelce made two big plays but all Nantz can do is gush about Mahomes. Truth is, Kelce and Tyreek Hill are probably going to have to win this game for KC.#SuperBowl

@TheRalphRetort It should be a much bigger news story that the Head coach of the chiefs son and linebackers coach is under investigation for involuntary manslaughter 2 days before the super bowl, the nfl won’t let KC win I promise u that
@GlennonDoyle live tweeting the #SuperBowl is better than watching the actual game
i think stone cold steve austin is gonna win the super bowl
These super bowl commercial are trash now 🤨
Remember when Super Bowl commercials used to be good?
My father described the Super Bowl as the “magician versus the tactician”, which I thought was pretty great #SuperBowlLV

@jbarro No. So disappointed he's ruined another Super Bowl.

Tax commercials out here during #SuperBowl while people outta work due to pandemic 🤔
Thought for a second the Chiefs were about to run a play from the Mean Machine playbook. #ChiefsKingdom #RunItBack #SuperBowl

What’s a super bowl?
I still believe the Chiefs will bounce back as they do best from falling back into double digits they'll score a touchdown before the end of the 1st half #SuperBowl https://t.co/m9K1ybXzyM
I love the Super Bowl ad featuring 23-time Paralympic medalist @JessicaLong for @Toyota #LetsGoPlaces. But wait, does anyone know if the Tokyo Olympics are Happening? #SBLV
How can I check live player stats for this super bowl? I can’t find em 🤦🏽‍♂️
Yeah I’m only watching the super bowl just for @theweeknd 🥲.
I think this is the first Superbowl where I honestly never heard of the halftime entertainer. Out of touch or Old or both probably.
If you woulda told me a year ago Brady would find Gronk for 2 TD’s in a Super Bowl not being on the Pats... heck I don’t even know
The @Buccaneers have scored 2 out of 3 times in the red zone.

The @Chiefs could end the half done by one score. That’s how good they are.

And another year he hosted a #SuperBowl party for his coworkers from the dealership. A buddy brought over his TV and they set it up in the dining room so that they wouldn’t miss a play when going to get pizza. I sat next to the dips and talked with their secretary all night.
Seeing @dudewithsign at the super bowl just made my night.
@elisecterry @WFKARS Y’all can talk to me about Tommy boy when he wins a Super Bowl while pregnant.
This year, If Tom Brady finally wins a Super Bowl without cheating, can we try it with no bull shit calls next year?

@TheRalphRetort I agree with you in theory I love Paul as well but the KC organization and the NFL are running cover on the story until after the super bowl and the media is complacent in the whole thing. 0% Chance the Chiefs win today.

TOMPA BLOWOUT #SuperBowl
Bout to turn this shit off #SuperBowl
Tyron Mathieu is HEATED. 

And I don’t blame him. That defense is letting him down. #SuperBowl
Keep settling for FGs KC. #SuperBowl
So Gronk was essentially a decoy all season set up for the Super Bowl? 

#SuperBowl
Blowout? Another Bucs touchdown. Playoff Fournette! 28-9 Bucs #SuperBowl
Happy to see @_fournette score in the #SuperBowl
ALI LEADING THE WAY FOR SUPER BOWL LENNY!!!!! TOUCHDOWN!!!!! #GoBucs #SuperBowl

PLAYOFF LENNY!!! #SuperBowl
#Bucs just smashed the #Chiefs on that drive #SuperBowl
This shit is over 😂😂😂 #SuperBowl
When you watch the #SuperBowl by yourself in a pandemic...it really just seems like an average Sunday night game. 😐
I’m proud of myself for switching up my routine and wrapped myself in a blanket burrito in the living room instead of my room. Although the Super Bowl is not The Golden Girls but it will have to do.
Touchdown!!! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 let’s go!! #SuperBowl
Y'all think the Refs are bad right now,  wait until Football Team gets to the Super Bowl again....it'll be BRUTAL.
LET’S GO BUCS! #SuperBowl #TampaBayBuccaneers

Fuck you, @Chiefs 😂😂 Why are you the way you are right now? #SuperBowl
This one is over!! #SuperBowl
Brady is killing Bill's legacy after the year the Patriots had without Brady and the year he is having in Tampa Bay and this Super Bowl. May not have been the coach for the last 20 years.

That sound in the distance just MIGHT be the floodgates opening up 😬#SuperBowl

@Kamehamehaas Mahomes is all time great, just picked a bad day for the worst game of his career. #SuperBowl
The real MVP of this Super Bowl is Tracy Morgan. #SuperBowl
@TomBrady is the greatest to ever do it. It’s a privilege to watch that man do what he does best. 

#GOAT #SuperBowlLV #SuperBowl
May Tom Brady never win another Super Bowl. And all the Saints said...

AMEN!
Tonight’s game is proof of the value of the offensive line.  #SuperBowl
This game makes the 13-3 Super Bowl seem exciting
Being off sundays and mondays... super bowl Sunday is my time to shine ... and Easter
CBS had more commercials than KC had touchdowns #SuperBowl
Mahomes didn’t lose this game for the Chiefs. Bad protection and terrible pass coverage did. #SuperBowl
Idk about that since Dallas ain’t going to the super bowl anytime soon 😂😂😂😂 https://t.co/8uy8efcKJb
Reasons why #Chiefs are losing the #SuperBowl

1) Tampa Bay is kicking their ass...
2) Not the refs...

A lot of people are sounding dumb.  Stop it.
Worst Super Bowl EVER! Bad commercials. Bad halftime show. Bad football. Bad officiating.
Super Bowl Was Sum Mid
I love me some Tommy Brady and I am super excited for ring number 7! I am also a big fan of Mahomes and can’t wait to see what he does in his career. #GoBucs #SuperBowl
@CBSSports are you paying your announcers to lead a pity party for Mahomes? Yes, he is a superb QB who's having a bad game. But the endless excuses about his "bad toe" and hard hits in earlier playoff games are inappropriate in a Super Bowl.
Pretty sure I should find new hobbies. I thought I was really good at watching sports but this Super Bowl has proved otherwise.
Unsportsmanlike conduct, taunting, just call it bullying ... with a peace sign. @NFL @SuperBowl https://t.co/iR7RvQ8yDl
Brady haters: “Belichick is the reason Brady won all those Super Bowls.”

Patriots: 7-9.

Brady: Goes to a team that hasn’t won a playoff game since 2002 and wins the Super Bowl in his first year with the team. Number 7 overall.

🐐
@BuzzJohnNabors it’s about to be trash talk Sunday. Where that Mahomes fan at? Where is ole 49er John? I told you and Joe last year when I called in we would be Super Bowl champs!
0PN was tangentially related to the Super Bowl and that’s all the win I need. Cards to win it next year. Hopefully I can feel less guilty watching football next year, but probably not.
So the @Buccaneers added two women to their coaching staff and  a Wolverine under center and now are about to win a Super Bowl. Coincidence? I think not.

This was the most UNFAIR GAME (Super Bowl LV) I have Ever Seen in my life! 🤬 @PatrickMahomes he did all the work with the Kicker! He had NO OFFENSIVE GUARDS! The offense was just Letting the Defense hit him or charge him!🤬

Remember when superbowl commercials used to be funny 🥴
@JordanDeArmon Wait the super bowl was today!? LOL
3 min left and Thomas already thinking about the next Super Bowl.
Honestly, did not expect this from Kansas City. The Chiefs got BLOWN out by @TomBrady! 

I am highly convinced Brady can get to 8 next year 🐐

Simple equation......if u can protect your QB and run the football you'll have a much better chance to win #RTR #SuperBowl
This is the second year in a row the Chiefs have been in the Super Bowl, and I can’t believe I still have to say this. 

It’s Missouri. Kansas CITY. MISSOURI.

This #SuperBowl is showing the world that there's two black Assistant coaches who should be Head Coaches in the NFL 👀👌🏾
I was dead wrong about Bowles’ defense collapsing in the second half. He did an unbelievable job and this defense put on a show. One of the best defensive performances in #SuperBowl history. Congrats to Todd Sr.🙏🏻

Oooof, I really don’t give a fig about pro sports...but my hubs loves the Chiefs with his whole ❤️. I feel badly for him. 

#SuperBowl
@mellinger for the minutes — not a question but more of a thought: 

Trying to keep perspective. Mahomes’ 10th career loss comes during his second super bowl appearance — all the while running for his life. 

We once had Brodie Croyle whose record was 0-10.
most boring Super Bowl ever
Game over #SuperBowl
@CoryTownes Blaine Gabbert. Super bowl champion
@allyspeirs @jeremieh @NFL @SuperBowl I like his music. I like how The Weeknd hustled to get his music out there some 10+ yrs ago. I like his singing voice. He's talented &amp; did a good job at #SBLV
Tom Brady is about to win another Super Bowl...it is insane...Brady and LeBron both winning Super Bowls in pandemic when so easy for chaos is really something. Also he is 43.

Love @VacationerBand getting a song in the super bowl!! Haven’t heard Paradise Waiting in so long!
But why tho it’s a competitive sport, u don’t think those guys talk shit to each other? Emotions are high it’s Super Bowl, I played sports in high school and I stayed talking shit to the other players, you get in their head throw em off,no need for a penalty cuz of it https://t.co/AGtNvZCsVs

I’m trying to move past my dislike of tom Brady to enjoy Leonard Fournette and Devin White winning a Super Bowl!
First Super Bowl I've actually since the ATL choke... and definitely gotta say that (real) football aka futbol aka soccer is so much better especially in big games. #ISaidWhatISaid
Blaine Gabbert is going to get a Superbowl ring....

7 😳😳😳 7 Super Bowl rings. That is absolutely ridiculous @TomBrady is the best ever.
If anybody should know how difficult it is to win a Super Bowl, you’d think it would be Tony Romo.
@dotsonc Like Romo has any experience in a super bowl, amirite?

I'm glad I didn't watch this tonight, because while I respect greatness, I believe my team was better than the one that's about to win the Super Bowl.

The head coach just refused to pull his Hall of Fame QB to the detriment of the rest of the roster.
@Linville34 P.S. I hate Brady and I hope he gets kidney stones after this #SuperBowl
SuperBowl right now &amp; I still don’t know 😬 https://t.co/GBu7IsieZl
Overall super bowl commercial rating about a D+. Will Ferrell GM take however hilarious, I will be buying a Cadillac.
My parents really be winning a superbowl pool talking about how they gonna split the money and I'm here with hundreds of dollars less because of them...
I think the worst part of the super bowl is that drake debuted a State Farm commercial. Does that guy really need some commercial money? Lame as hell
Tom Brady really brought a pos team to the super bowl
@TomBrady is going for 10 Rings in the next 5 years #SuperBowl #Brady
FashionNova be having a sale for anything....I ain’t never heard of a Super Bowl sale.....I mean I bought something but dang calm down 😂
The 3 ads that stood out the most to me:
- Doritos 3D
- Jeep
- Amazon

And they all featured big name celebrities. 

50 years of #SuperBowl spots and star power still works. Of course plenty of forgettable spots with celebs too, it’s not that easy.

Immediately after Tom Brady wins the super bowl, I looked at my fiancé dead in the eye and said: “I bet he has a small wiener. The guy can’t have it all.”
The best defensive performance in the Super Bowl all time is obviously the #Seahawks in SB XLVIII holding the best offense in League history to 8 points. 

Tonight’s performance from Tampa is the second best I’ve ever seen.
No denying it, Tom Brady is the best of all time #SuperBowl
@magdalenakala @Kirbobangss Hope so 🙏🏾 He definitely wins in the long run. Covid Super Bowl will always be remembered haha

Guy from the future says: "Tom Brady wins #SuperBowl w @Buccaneers. Throws 2 TD to Gronk, who came out of retirement. 1 to Antonio Brown too. Fournette ran wild. They beat Brees, Rodgers &amp; Mahomes in playoffs. And coming back for more w Bruce A. + that defense." Ok, future guy 👀
@Klarna #Klarna4thDown can we all agree Spongebob won the Super Bowl with that performance?!
Ya Brady has 7 rings... ya Mahomes struggled.. the real takeaway from #SuperBowl is that I will never drink Oatly again..
I think Tom Brady needs to play for a different team each year so everybody can get a Super bowl.
Congratulations to Tom Brady for winning the Super Bowl. And his team did well too.

Tom Brady has won 12.7% of all Superbowls. #SuperBowl #Brady #Buccaneers
Y’all teams be going to the super bowl and lose ? How pathetic
#SuperBowl #Brady has taught us lessons in discipline, hard work, humility, teamwork... and never underestimate someone based on age. Experience is valuable.
Okay, okay, okay...@TomBrady is the G.O.A.T.

The moral of this super bowl is: don't let the bucs into a super bowl against the AFC West because it will be a blowout.

Super Bowl XXXVII: Raiders 21 Bucs 48
Super Bowl LV: Chiefs 9 Bucs 31

This man at 43 went to another team.  Football is not a sport where one player usually puts you over the top This is not Basketball/Baseball where an Ace Pitcher can win you a Pennant.  He’s the GOAT. &amp; I’m not a Brady fan, but you have to respect legends and history  #SuperBowl

So happy for Tom Brady and gronk. Jealous they aren’t pats anymore but wow this 7th super bowl ring seemed like the easiest to win.

Feel like the #JeepCommercial is one of those divisive #SuperBowl ads.
Half my chat group loved it, the others did not. My favourite was probably @AnheuserBusch. Overall a bit of a subdued year. Which makes sense I suppose... #SuperBowlCommercials #superbowlads
THIS IS WHY I'VE REFUSED TO WATCH THE SUPERBOWL FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS; IF I SAW THAT COMMERCIAL I'D BE THROWING SHIT AT MY TV &amp; WRECKING EVERYTHING IN SIGHT. #FuckTheNFL. https://t.co/5Vcg1owf34
I’m not hating on The Weekend one bit, but I sure would like the see the @foofighters play the Super Bowl Half Time Show soon.

Well work was the most boring part of my day. I called the Super Bowl and now I’m enjoying a blizzard from DQ.

Good on CBS for advertising the equalizer during the superbowl cus I had no idea that was even a thing💀, watched it and it was actually really cool lol
@DailyPayoutBook The Chiefs scored 9 Points!!!!! You will never win a Super Bowl scoring only 3 field goals and ZERO Touchdowns
@_fournette From cut list Lenny to Super Bowl Lenny in one season. #GoBucs
Hit my biggest pay out from betting today! $2,000 from the super bowl 🤑 God I really need to go to Vegas w/ this skill....
Antonio Brown really did everything wrong, and still won a Super Bowl 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I may in the minority but I really liked @theweeknd performance tonight.  Was it on par with some of the classic Super Bowl performances like Prince, Michael Jackson, etc.? No but it was solid...
The streets in downtown Tampa are PACKED full of @Buccaneers fans celebrating the team’s Super Bowl win.  The Bucs are the first team ever to play the Super Bowl inside their home stadium — and win.

if @taylorswift13 doesn’t perform at the super bowl in 2022, it will be a missed opportunity and we will not be able to recover
So what will i remember from this Superbowl...probably the dozens of disturbing jockstrap face wearing dancers...thats it, nothing from the boring ass game itself at all.
The amount of in person attendance at the stadium for super bowl 😬😬
@ajbomaye Legend has it, he didn’t sleep for 14 days straight leading up to the super bowl in order to devise the perfect gameplan.
Lesson of the day: You can’t please boomers when it comes to the Super Bowl halftime.
Congrats to @Buccaneers and @TomBrady and @RobGronkowski on the Super Bowl 55 win! Congrats as well to the @Chiefs for a great season. Don't worry @PatrickMahomes you have plenty of years to keep playing and chase more Super Bowls! Chin up my friend!

What folks who are on the left, with me, need to realize is that most people in the middle are right where you’re at on the “culture war” issues that make you mad at the @Jeep #SuperBowl ad and the suggestion that Americans should come together.
@POTUS The SuperBowl was a Joke, the last President was a Clown, don't become the Ring leaders of the Circus of 2021 Congress. Pass the Stimulus that includes the $15 wage increase and unemployment extension. Keep Americans needs First, by any means necessary...

While we keeping it 100 on Mahomes, he has stunk it up in 7 out of 8 quarters of his super bowl appearances. The 49ers collapse last year in the SB making him look a lot better than he’s played.

@PSchrags I mean a little continuity on the bad officiating would have helped the Chiefs get some rythm. A couple of the missed Pi calls that should have gone in our favor could have helped with momentum but we'll never know. Legit score shpuld be 24-9
https://t.co/NU65bIV6RS
Still crazy that they filled up the stadium for the super bowl, but won’t allow visitors for doctors appointments.
Remember when Tom Brady was in on the scheme to deflate a football and went to win a Super Bowl?

Brady did what Garoppolo couldn't, put points on the board and pull away while your defense is keeping Mahomes in check. That's why he got MVP (plus the QB bias). #SuperBowl #SuperBowlLV

Wow I cannot believe what is being said about Tom Brady and the Super Bowl fix!!! Tom Brady was given breaks by officials all 7 times he won. I did not watch and not a big Brady fan, but can’t you find a real reason your team lost.
Also I may sound petty but for a commentator to say Brady has done his career “the right way” when he literally got caught cheating in the super bowl and suffered a weaker punishment than JG for smoking a joint makes me hate the dude even more

Congratulations to Tampa Bay Buccaneers... well played. Great game. KC go back again next year, please. #SuperBowl
I think my greatest Super Bowl take was not trying to be edgy about an all time half time show from the attitude of a dead publication?
I am both surprised and impressed that I didn’t tweet anything sarcastic during the Super Bowl about the game, any players, coaches, “records” or commercials. This was made easier by turning the game off in the second quarter. You’re welcome.

@AllWaltrip Moral of this super bowl is don't mess with old quarter backs and old people 🤠
Super bowl 55?? Sounds like too many to me
@Brianfink im so confused r u live or not? Lol #BigGamePostParty #SuperBowl
Worst Tom Brady Super Bowl win of my life.
You put Eli on the Chiefs I’ll bet every belonging he wins the super bowl
Fell asleep during the super bowl. Woke up and the news was on. ! The craziest thing is everytime I flip channels I’m wondering where are the #korean channels/ shows! 🤷🏽‍♂️

Missed the first half of the Super Bowl... and totally good with that. https://t.co/rE1mcJx70O
I’ve been a Kansas City Chiefs fan all my life. The Chiefs and I are the same age — we’re both 61.

Here’s what I know: Losing the Super Bowl the year after you won it is better than enduring 50 years without going to the Super Bowl.

Go Chiefs!

#SuperBowl #ChiefsKingdom
I’m gonna be that guy: there should not have been fans at the Super Bowl. Like what even was the point? 

It’s like a bad coping mechanism lol
Isn’t she a beaut?! 😍

With Super Bowl LV on our air tonight we thought it was the perfect day to reveal our brand new set! 👊🏼 

We hope you love it, because @WLNSSheriJones, @WLNS_David, @ChivonOnAir and I really do! https://t.co/mAmHJuKQBp

I am impressed at how people are theorizing a team that lost by 22 points was "robbed" by the refs. It's truly incredible. #SuperBowl
How bout them Buccaneers!! SUPER-BOWL 55 Champions‼️💥🔥🏈👍🏾 @ Orlando, Florida https://t.co/2fVWky0nDs
@dandwerson @goooodluckchuck @PatrickMahomes What have you been smoking on? Seriously! The man won you a super bowl ring last year vs San Francisco 49ers.
If that pass is caught with @PatrickMahomes horizontal it's the greatest play in Superbowl history. Legit. The kid is the real deal. Thank you sir, as a football fan, for being so gracious and such a great role model for our kids. Doesn't matter what team I rep.
Didn't watch the Superbowl due to my close to 30 year Boycott of the @NFL I did sorta listen to 45 seconds of the game because a coworker was playing it on his phone next to me. Just wish I didn't have to seee updates on this. Should have stayed off Twitter
@MCD2397 The only reason i watched the super bowl lolol and the food
Madonna had the best Super Bowl performance sorry Bey.
this will be Mahomes ONLY super bowl loss, and as long as his week 1 O-line stays healthy, he will defeat Tom Brady in SB LVI
I feel so happy for this guy. Has dominated at Nebraska and at Tampa Bay. Always under rated. Now Super Bowl Champion. #ChampaBay #Bucs https://t.co/yXBRNm5LbK

Awful Superbowl on defense you either got caught holding or you didn't 🏈🏈🏈. The refs had players on defense feel terrible🏈🏈. You either was caught holding or not
Brady had to go thru, Brees and Rodgers for this Super bowl and Mahomes backyard playin football ass. Give this nigga a Medal of Honor
You know you don’t HAVE to watch the Super Bowl. It’s not compulsory I promise you
@JoseCanseco do teams still review films after the super bowl? They should. There’s still so much to take away from an important game
Look for symbol RRR to dip tomorrow when they calculate my Super Bowl sports book winnings, which were OVER $3.00. 💰

@Tucker_TnL Brady went 2004 to 2014 without a super bowl win? What a bum! 😂
The Weeknd is freaking awesome, but he isn’t a halftime show kinda guy and neither is his music. It’s good music, just not Super Bowl halftime music.
I’m so grateful I missed out on the super bowl live tweets because I was at work 🥰 I simply cannot pretend to give a fuck about sp*rts

Sad 💔 to see my favorite NFL team @chiefs lose in this #SuperBowl but my respect for Brady has grown exponentially. He is just amazing and tonight he was unstoppable.
A little disappointed no one in Tampa is trying to climb greased poles or lighting any fires, but hey THE TAMPA BAY BUCCANEERS ARE SUPER BOWL CHAMPIONS

@ScreamsBehind Tom Brady winning another Super Bowl.... oh wait he didn’t die, dammit!!
@JerzeeJoker348 I think it’s dumb to compare a sudden death game to a possible 7 game series. We only watch the Super Bowl one time every year. Each game in a Finals series is different so I never understood how one could compare the two
Super happy for another Super Bowl win for Brady and Gronk!!
When it’s not even a day after the Super Bowl and you starting pissing off Dodgers fans
@theweeknd’s half time show was not everyone’s cup of tea. But that doesn’t mean it was entirely without merit. Y’all complain too much. #SuperBowl #HalfTimeShow
Bucs got TWO Super Bowl Chips 🏆🏆 they the favorite next season too! But the Packers are coming!
Update: there are comments in agreement. Should I tell them that putting a major stadium in every state so every state can have a Super Bowl, while a novel idea, hurts the long term economic growth for the area. Sure, it's a one time boom, but what about the other 364 days that
I spent all of today in the house alone. I could‘ve did some Super Bowl festivities but I felt it was important to spend alone time. That’s how most of my days are spent. I’m creating my own world where I prioritize myself and make decisions that showcase how much I value myself.

Its funny seeing how many giant corporations didn't buy a Super Bowl ad because they were too afraid of coming across as “tone-deaf”

The issue is, if you can't run a commercial one of the only times it's actually worth buying a commercial, then your company is probably tone-deaf https://t.co/7YoarUDL7E
As a Giants fan, I was always mad about seeing Tom Brady &amp; the Patriots in the Super Bowl every year. 

Now, I see Brady and all I can do is just appreciate his greatness. Congrats to the GOAT on #7
Now I’ve come to realize that who’s really behind Patriots’ dominance in the past 20 years. Tom Brady is the GOAT. Like him or hate him, that is up to personal opinion. I’m just glad I have opportunity to watch him play over these years. #SuperBowl #CongratsBucs
I guess I’ll have to watch all the Super Bowl commercials later via YouTube.
We need Drake in the Super Bowl next year and I don’t mean at the halftime show. He needs to join a team.
@SportsCenter Almost? This isn’t horseshoes or hand grenades. #SuperBowl

Used to volunteer at a crisis hotline. Super Bowl Sunday was brutal. Domestic violence, alcohol and drug abuse. Takes the joy out of the day.
It’s officially the end of the 2020 - 2021 NFL season and I ended my annual NFL Playoffs predictions with a 5-7 record. It’s not the best record but it’s also not the worst.

Let’s hope that the @Packers are back here in 2021 and in the @SuperBowl!! 😏 #NFLPlayoffs #SuperBowl https://t.co/zakpSemwBx
Didn’t watch the Super Bowl because of work but I already know the refs cheated for Brady.
Biden got 80 million votes.
And Tampa Bay won the Super Bowl.
Tonight just feels unreal. The fact that we were in a back to back super bowl and got blown out just feels like it never even happened. Ugh

One of the best parts of watching #SuperBowl was when my dad saw a sad looking Patrick Mahomes towards the end of the game as soon as there was no hope left to win and he gave a pep talk to the screen saying don’t worry you’re young you still have time and plenty more chances!

@BryanJP19 @FLOTUS @POTUS Fairly certain Biden agrees with you, but unfortunately your specific problem has landed on the longer end of shit that needs to be repaired after the last 4 years. You can surely admit that whatever level the Super Bowl occurred at was outside the level Biden could control. Yes?

It’s an open call audition for “Florida Man.” 

The score may be in @Buccaneers favor, but thanks to irresponsible decisions by @NFL and @GovRonDeSantis , the real winner is Covid.

@gregp134 @ThugWilson3 @barstoolsports Interesting move to be deep throating Brady in this thread while also having the guy that beat him twice in the super bowl as your header. If you’re going for irony, Nick Foles would make a great PFP.

My favorite moment during the Super Bowl was the 10 second Reddit ad
5 years ago, my mom &amp; I  watched the Superbowl together at my house. Here's a snippet of that day:
Mom: Who are you rooting for?
Me: I don't know, I like both teams.
Mom: Me too.
Me: Oh really, can you tell me what teams are playing?
Laughter ensued.

Not trying to get anyone’s attention by tweeting about the Super Bowl. 

But, I just watched my first Super Bowl today and I think I kinda know why this game became a huge part of people’s lives here in the US🤔🤔
What a memorable Bucs season if you missed it all I feel bad for you. If you don't watch football, sucks for you. What a remarkable season with an unforgettable conclusion. What a season. What a story. Glad to have witnessed history and lived it #GoBucs #SuperBowl 31-9 🏆🏈

@TitusONeilWWE How Much fun did you have at The Super Bowl to watch the Tampa Bay Buccaneers win against the Kansas City Chiefs?
Super Bowl 50 holds more and more meaning to me as the years go by. XXXII and XXXIII I was 7 and 8 and it didn’t mean much to me. But 50 I felt the whole meaning of winning a Super Bowl
@PaulHBK Yup! Shot my second super bowl🙌
the browns will win the super bowl next year. you heard it here first 🤷🏼‍♂️
@GraceRemiWTSP I don’t think there are rules after a Bucs Super Bowl win.
@ProFootballTalk What the hell did the #49ers do to you, Florio? Every single time you can turn a story into a negative about the niners you do it. Aging Tampa qb beats young superstar chiefs qb in super bowl. And what are you thinking and reporting? “Man the niners suck.”

The best part of the super bowl was Brady going at Mathieu! Tom set that bitch ass straight by getting the win! 😂😂😂 Fuck the Cheifs!!
What the f'ng he'll is wrong with people. Don't you get 24/7 reminders to wear a damn mask or wash your hands. Do you really think that an extra helping from the Superbowl is going to change things. It's entertainment. If you go to a movie they aren't going to stop to remind you! https://t.co/ho6BhlQM7f

and even though it’s no where near enough, I’d love to celebrate that 3 HBCU alumni just won a SuperBowl ring. thats important

For someone who just lost the super bowl, Pat Mahomes probably gave the best possible postgame answers  after the loss. This dude is a pure leader and will be in many more Super Bowls. Tom Brady will always be the 🐐 tho
It’ll be such a great moment when Tom Brady gets to play against his son in Super Bowl LXV
I’m Kinda late but the super bowl halftime show was the best halftime show they have ever had in Super Bowl history

I mean this very literally, I can't imagine what it feels like for your team to win a superbowl. I bet it's awesome
Boy couldn't even get a touchdown. My quarterback would NEVER in the Super Bowl. https://t.co/sfV2OLF1u2
What we not finna do is say Shakira can’t handle a solo performance when her entire music career has handled stadiums/Arenas by herself. @NFL Please I demand Shakira’s come back at The #SuperBowl for a SOLO!!! #SuperBowlWeeknd #TheWeeknd https://t.co/WvBtPwlhDl

“Hell no I ain’t going anywhere. I’m coming back, trying to get two and then we’ll see after that, but no this football team, I love these guys and we have a great staff, great team,” Bruce Arians said after becoming oldest coach to win a Super Bowl #SBLV

There is no way Hill said they planned to play against man to man tonight, are you for real? Your coaches that are national level couldn’t even see that man to man didn’t work for them last time so WHY FORCE IT IN THE SUPER BOWL? WHOS PAYING THESE COACHES LMAOOO
Brady cements himself as the 🐐

I got more to say about that though 🤔

This is a @BluCloudRadio Stan account. Until they report on the Super Bowl I won’t believe anything break downs. ESPN count your days.
@Keith02 My bad. Didn't see this til late. Was engrossed with the Super Bowl even tho it wasn't all that engrossing itself. They were on Colbert. Think the performance is available on Instagram.

@DrEricDing Why did we have a Super Bowl at all?  The NBA and the National Baseball League handle their championships more responsibly. Letting cities use the stadiums doesn't make up for the damage that will come.
never working another super bowl again

@RBReich @iPicNews @Kaepernick7 Why did we have a Super Bowl this year anyway, and in Florida of all places. Those people who went to Florida will now go to their home states and possibly spread the virus there. This on top of people gathering to watch in spite of warnings.

Unless Bill Belichick gets a top tier QB like Rodgers or Watson. He’s never going to win another Super Bowl again, and people will slowly start to realize he’s the most overrated coach of all time.

Also for the love of God stop sharing the “20k+ at the super bowl but we can’t have a 200 person show at (your favorite dive)???” Meme. Comparing the two is ludicrous on a number of scales;
- The arena has seating and room for spacing to occur and for ordered entry/exit

But I could help but wonder was the half time show really that bad? Or American’s just THAT spoiled? #iwantitigotit #SuperBowl #HalfTimeShow
So are we talking about how this SuperBowl was the worst abomination in the face of Covid of any major entertainment event during the pandemic? They hardly f*cking tried - huge crowds, hardly any social distancing, sparse mask use, people that didn’t need to be there. Failure.

Most underwhelming Super Bowl ever. Advertisers... what happened?
Uber No. 5: Four rich, intoxicated college kids leaving a loud Super Bowl party and heading downtown to a bar. They were extremely loud, gave me a headache, and bragged about being in jail for 43 minutes once 😒 3/10, cause I liked their accents, but that's it.
Uber No. 4: Two guys leaving a Super Bowl party and heading home. Found out from them the Buccaneers won, yaaaaayyyy I guess, I don't really care 😂 7/10 because they made my car smell heavily of weed and cigarettes, but they were nice.
Uber No. 2: Another guy coming from a Super Bowl with his cousins. Real nice, fell asleep in the backseat, took him to the Hard Rock resort. 9/10, he was super chill.
Uber No.1: A very, very intoxicated man in Kissimmee coming from a Super Bowl party. Asked me to move in with him. Wanted to tip me $30 but didn't know how to work the app. 7/10 because he was a nice guy 😂

the energy tonight after the Tampa Bay Buccs won the Super bowl in Tampa Bay was insane, one guy even brought his pet baby goats to celebrate

@mellinger Sam, that my be true but this game is also inextricably tied to awful overofficiating in the first half.

6 penalties led to 1st downs. 2 TDs.  Most in Superbowl history...in one half. Chiefs most penalized half with Andy...

It changed the game. Period. Not debatable

Making fun of sports is boring. Making fun of people who like to watch sports is tired. The halftime show was excellent. Tom Brady is a POS.

Diversity within professionals sports is a huge problem in today’s society but Tampa’s staff shows promise. BA hired minorities and women onto his coaching staff.

For everyone with the who are crying “Refs did us dirty”, you may have a point, but you also have to consider that half of your starting O-Line was out, and some of the throws that Mahomes threw would’ve been ESPN Top 10 plays, IF THE RECEIVERS COULD CATCH EM! #SuperBowl
@CRKirby5 They also said it was Tom Brady’s first ever Super Bowl with an opening drive TD. Too bad they went 3-and-out on their first possession though 😂
Congratulations 2 the #TampaBayBuccaneers. You made history twice this season. This first team to host the #SuperBowl and play in the Super Bowl.

@NFLonCBS The "Super Bowl" was a flop. The officiating was whack and contributed greatly to the Bucks winning. The Bucs benefitted greatly from calls at crucial times. Brady is the luckiest qb. I stopped watching at half time. The KC defense put absolutely no pressure on Brady.

Probably the most impressive thing about Tom’s run is he went 10 years without a Super Bowl between age 27 and 37. That could be what led him to the TB12 diet. Also, the Patriots wasted his peak years. Lots of counterfactuals, not sure he’d be playing now if they finished 19-0.
@Caitlin_WTSP @SuperBowl @Twitter @FOX46News Well I’m sick 😷 so technically that’s why I’m home but it helps after a short night of sleep!

Wow RT @JamesPalmerTV: Tom Brady now has more Super Bowl titles than every NFL franchise.
Pat Mchomie has looked bad in every quarter he ever played in the Super Bowl.  Beside one 4 th quarter he been below average. The media is afraid to criticize the guy. He gets a complete pass @KenCarman @SportsBoyTony why is this? Especially nationally.
@NFL just read this on FB 'Superbowl Sunday: We won't know the winner for weeks. Mail-in touchdowns and “extra points” have to be counted.'
Looked forward to Super Bowl 55 with Mahomes vs Brady matchup. But was totally disappointed in the lopsided blowout that made for a terrible game. Congrats to Tampa Bay. "Super Bowl LV: Bucs win their second Super Bowl in franchise history" #SuperBowlLV https://t.co/hKkofwLWmT

@BarnettTulani @flyingbackbeest @Reneejo7 @Yasuke1886 @stephenasmith Is this your first time watching? Even after 5 yards you must pull the jersey, prevent movement or alter the receiver in some way. They always allowed the defender to touch the receiver as long you don't grab, tug or pull. Refs ruin the Superbowl. The game was already over.

That was a dominant performance on both sides of the ball by Tampa Bay. And the 🐐 &amp; Co. left points on the board!

I am old school. I love watching a dominant defense and a clock-killing offense. The other guy can’t beat you when he’s getting bench-splinters.

@JoshDaws The Super Bowl was over at 10:15 Eastern. In a World Series game, that would’ve been the fourth inning.
Super Bowl takeaways...Brady is still the 🐐, as I’ve been saying all along Mathieu’s mouth running is bad, KC looked off from the jump, and the refs don’t win the entirety of any game so please stop. Oh and most importantly @PatrickMahomes remains my QB1! #GoChiefs
@jill_fran When I worked for Coca-Cola I did this math for them. I was told appearing during the super bowl wasn't about return on ad value.
@AndrewPollackFL remember when the Patriots won the super bowl for what fifth sixth time and his team went to the White House, Brady refused to go he does not like our president.  I love the Pat's team and I respected Tom Brady until he started snubbing the president. As has belichick.
@GeoffreyInsch It was good. I ate a lot of really salty things so it hit the spot. Hand me another bottle and I will happily drink it. Aftertaste left a bit to be desired perhaps. Had no idea that it had a commercial in the Super Bowl! Raised my drink high when it aired.
@PSchrags  Although I wake up a little disappointed this morning , #15 in three short years took this club to 3 championships and won a super bowl.  I’m certain we will be right back in the conversation next season #love my chiefs

That was the most boring Super Bowl since the one two years ago, Pats v Rams. Last year’s wasn’t that much better.

We only get like 2 or 3 Super Bowls a decade that are actually good games.

The last two I can think of are SB LI (only because of the comeback) &amp; SB LII (shootout)
@BenVolin An assistant coach being in a horrific drunk driving accident (alleged) days before the Super Bowl indicates a lack of focus in the organization.

Tom Brady has more Super Bowl wins than the bottom 18 NFL franchises COMBINED. He is the GOAT. ⛽️

@BrianClowdus Like when his team won the super bowl and he refused to go to the White House and he snubbed the president there you go. I remember that very clearly I remember him crying when the world hated him. Such hypocrisy.
@kidnoble To be fair there are multiple grand slam opportunities per year and only 1 Super Bowl/NBA Finals. Brady could've won the Super Bowl every year he's been in the league and "only" have 21. All are very impressive, but it's really apples to oranges.
Prediction: Tom Brady wins Super Bowl LXX (70), is named MVP, and earns his 23rd SB ring. Patriots fans throw Bill Belichick into Boston harbor.

Last night was everything you deserve. You are so big time!! Super Bowl Cam!!! https://t.co/kExmZALwuU

@jason_meister Oh please!! This man snubbed our president when his team went to the White House after super bowl win he refused to go. A hat was in his locker in 2015 because it was mailed to him he never wore he didn't give a damn about it. Such hypocrisy.
now drake wanna be on super bowl commercials, but can’t drop a single from certified lover boy
Is their a worse Monday to work than after the super bowl?
It’s the #Monday after the #SuperBowl. If you work in  #waste or #recycling, be #safe today and everyday. @NSCsafety @Teamsters @AFLCIO @OSHA_DOL #mondaythoughts @WasteManagement @RepublicService @GFLenv @RumpkeNews @NYCSanitation @TonyDanza @ISWA_org @CMReynoso34
and after all that, tom brady went into this game as an underdog and completely outplayed the guy you all say is coming for his crown but look who’s the super bowl champion for the 7th time... idc i don’t wanna f*ckin hear it anymore.

@RepLoudermilk @RachelRollarTV @newsmax The Kansas City Chiefs have reportedly retained Jay Sekulow to represent them in a federal legal challenge to the 2021 Super Bowl results.

After watching alone , athe (imho lopsided, but excellent) Super Bowl mmm; Sports Central; and the Equalizer; local News; then Steven Colbert and South Park, then went to bed... then while sleeping had bad dreams. Even though I am a Brady, and a fan of all the other programs...
I’ll be honest, the @SuperBowl streaker last night made me feel like we are getting back to some sort of normalcy.

Am I the only one feeling like a Monday after the Super Bowl should be a day off? 😁
Ok. 

So the Glazers wanted to win the #SuperBowl they went and bought brandy for the Bucs and he won them the damn championship. 

Why the fuck didn’t they buy Jordan Sancho and a good defender for @ManUtd ? 

Same fucking concept. You buy quality you get results.
Antoine Winfield Jr. joins Larry Izzo as Highlanders who have won the Super Bowl. Winfield attended The Woodlands HS and Izzo, like me, attended McCullough HS, which later became TWHS.
Tom Brady has won 12.7% of all Super Bowls.  

Some folks still have the audacity to say he's not the GOAT.

Message 2 @SeanADesai from a little old #Bears fan after Superbowl. We have the same type of players. Goldman will be back. Did u notice Shaq or JPP not dropping in coverage. Corners playing on receivers instead of 12 yards off. Attack mode is a great thing. Pressure busts pipes!

After last year’s Super Bowl I flew Patrick Mahomes’ grandma from Miami to Dallas (I miss you 757). She came up front and excitedly told us that her grandson just won the Super Bowl. I just keep thinking about her today. Thanks a lot for making an old lady sad, Tom Brady, ya jerk

Jail their competitors. No WORLD SPACE PROGRAM no WORLD peace no citizens OVERSIGHT COMMITTEES no WORLD Rememberace Day on Easter for Covid 19 guess the super bowl is always fixed by the PRESIDENT.
Chiefs just played in another Super Bowl man. Relax and enjoy the ride baby!! Go Chiefs!!
Regarding that last post...

Tons of Brady haters out there, and also no other NFL quarterbacks EVER with 7 Super Bowl rings.

People seem to hate those who put in the effort and get to celebrate the rewards.

That's called ACCOMPLISHMENT!

Turning 50 soon. Think a lot about aging and my fading athleticism. Get down on myself when I can’t break a 10-min mile pace. Then I watch a 43-yr-old who looked like this at age 22 win his 5th Super Bowl MVP.

Sometimes age IS just a number, kiddos. See you at the starting line. https://t.co/ZfNW58u2uB

Thank you @MollyEvensen you did a great job in the Super Bowl commercial. I laughed out-loud
@MikeSielski @dlboardman Mahomes is very good. I believe as good of an early career as there has been, along with Dan Marino (who went to the Super Bowl as a rookie). Whether or not he will be a fixture in the final game remains to be seen. Marino always had problems getting back to the final game.

I saw plenty of older folks not liking the super bowl halftime but then I remember they do nothing in live events or music to have a solid opinion besides prince gave a great show years ago. Y’all hate change. Tragic. Cries in XO.
The only thing worse than the Chiefs offensive line last night at #SuperBowl was the halftime show. First, I had to look up who it was. Secondly, it was lip synced. Finally, no instruments and computerized "music".

3. Get yo ass moving

I’m pretty happy for the Tampa team. Like it kinda would’ve been awk to win 2 yrs in a row. Everyone loves an underdog. That’s what’s so endearing about the chiefs- we blew for like 20 yrs. Also the fact that the superbowl was in their city.. i mean I’d feel terrible if they lost
I wonder if the people talking shit about shows watched the Super Bowl last night?

Brady has defeated some great quartbacks in Superbowl that some argue making him GOAT. They include Brees, Rogers, and Mahomes. Not on this list is @EliManning and @Giants - his kryptonite in a #Superbowl.  #justsaying #GiantsPride

@Annehead74 @brittanylynne8 😂😂are you serious? They ALWAYS show the quarterback’s reaction  in every game. so hide his face because he is getting creamed. That is part of sports.  I’m assuming you watch football once a year, on Super Bowl Sunday.
Dear @NFL, @pepsi and @SuperBowl halftime show committee. When picking an artists to perform for 15 mins during halftime, please stick to artists who are considered entertaining! For example @ciara @chrisbrown @Usher @britneyspears @MissyElliott etc. artists who put 100 percent
One of cousins that I don’t know performed in the Super Bowl halftime show. Now I feel bad for calling it a weak performance ooops 😬 😂

@ShannonSharpe Tom Brady payed the refs off to win this Super Bowl
Patriots going 12-4 next year and winning the super bowl.
In so happy Tom Brady and the Buccaneers won the Super Bowl but I was seriously dreading coming into work today knowing the guys were gonna be talking about it all day 😩

If ever there was a time a coach or coordinator should've garnered Superbowl MVP, it was last night with Todd Bowles.

@AmandiOnAir @DanMarino @MiamiDolphins @DolphinsHistory @NFL Before anyone gives @TomBrady a trophy, don’t forget that the Chiefs have the right to exhaust every legal avenue to challenge the result.

@PhilMackey Ah yes, I too will always remember the myriad of plays Brady scrambled around making off schedule plays in the Super Bowl. Without that the Bucs would have lost by 70, maybe 80 points.
@DiamondandSilk Yes, and if you are a fan of #football the last authentic #SuperBowl was in 2020 last night was fake they politicized the game just because @TomBrady had a relationship with our great President Trump #PatrickMahomes gave the game away purposely just simply to spite #Trump #NFL
Tom Brady:  7 for 10 in #SuperBowl - thats crazy!  

Brady has been to 10 Super Bowls in 21 seasons for 47%. 

Steph Curry’s career 3 point percentage is 43%. 

That means Brady is more likely to play in a SB than Curry is to make a 3??  🤔😳

Next year, I’m making 3 bets on the Super Bowl: The coin toss, will the team that calls the coin toss be correct, &amp; will the team that wins the coin toss win the game.
Dan Marino made a Super Bowl in his second season after throwing a then record of 50 some odd touchdowns and after that he didn't even sniff another Super Bowl and Marino is in the Hall of Fame and is one of the greats

You can compete in 1 super bowl per year, and the variables fully depend on your teams performance. Tennis gives you the chance to compete in 4 major grand slams a year and it’s all on you.

i can’t lie , the way @TomBrady came down to Tampa, helped build a depth chart, &amp; lead a stumbling team to a Super Bowl Win AT HOME in TAMPA BAY with no pre-season or prior history with any player other than Gronk &amp; AB(briefly)? Historic. Nothing Less.

2nd worst super bowl
i ever seen in my life 🤦🏾‍♂️ (first was that 2000 Ravens vs Giants)
@BrandonRivers20 🤸🏻‍♀️🤸🏻‍♀️🤸🏻‍♀️from my point of view...
l👀ks like You're The WINNER of the #SuperBowl.
lols u might STILL be "winning" 21hours later 🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
Got to rush and interview Josh McCown over a guy like Leftwich though. Some coached have to prove it in super bowl, some get bet on or considered for other reasons https://t.co/K1Pv0uxQMI
If you live in #onespartanburg &amp; want to know who won the #SuperBowl you’ll need to wait till maybe Tuesday or Wednesday to find out if you read @GoUpstate - because in today’s paper you’ll find the winner of all of Saturday’s basketball games... 🙄 https://t.co/Z4F2cCLOVM
If #Oatly actually takes off because of their #SuperBowl commercial I’m going to start eating more cheese. And that’s NOT a good thing!

@MartyDark2 @bhmsr @Chiefs @Broncos @tyreekhill_10 @TravisKelceSZN @OldTakesExposed Only thing @bhmsr &amp; @Chiefs have going is @TomBrady will probably only play another 4-5 years so after that if @PatrickMahomes is still relevant they may get another #SuperBowl
This Super Bowl was personal for my la dawg you see it lol congrats bby boy @_fournette https://t.co/BcudrSla3M
Maybe, it should be called “BradyBowl” instead of #SuperBowl 🥴
It felt like  (what I imagine) I was on shrooms watching 75% of the super bowl ads yesterday . They were cool though
@chrisparente @KenClarkTV @ShaulTurner @channel2kwgn @CHRISTOMER I’ll have to be honest too...didn’t watch much of Super bowl...🏈. We did catch the “flat” Matthew McConaughey commercial...my girls where like?! What happened to him🤣🤣We watched Lonesome Dove🥰🤠🐴🐴
Having the honor to coach &amp; mentor young women has been one of the best blessings I have ever received. I coached Kayla through middle &amp; high school cheer, watched her as USF sun doll &amp; 5 years w/the Bucs. From middle school to superbowl! She has done it all! I am SO PROUD! https://t.co/JbRTIO6062
Here’s a wild thought:

Super Bowl LV would have been a PRIME opportunity for the @NFL to put action where its money is and announce the hiring of @Kaepernick7 in a corporate role designed to champion diversity and inclusion in the league. 

IJS 🏈
It's amazing how the incorrect national narrative swung from "Brady is a system QB" to "Brady carried Belichick to 6 Super Bowl titles."

@undisputed @RealSkipBayless The single reason why Tom Brady won the Super Bowl was because of the Tampa Bay defense no doubt about that.
Only the NFC East can stop Brady in a Super Bowl

I still ain’t watched the Super Bowl
Chiefs committed stupid penalties all year. In the super bowl did the same thing. Glitz and glam of their offense saved them through their mental lapses. A coach told me blaming the refs creates a culture of a victim mentality and teaches that you don’t have to be responsible!

Superbowl? More like Super Bolang
One of the media outlets has already dubbed Tampa winning the Super Bowl at home ChampaBay. this new word panders to the lowest common denominator. Idiocracy has landed. Just say congratulations  to the Tampa Bay buccaneers.
@Phlyers24 Marino and Montana didn’t change conferences , take 7-9 to the super bowl and win it. Brady was sought out to be a product of Belichek and proved that narrative wrong. Brady is the goat of the NFL and arguably the goat of goats
My Super Bowl observation is that Tom Brady appears to be a very genuinely warm hugger. He really brought it in and shared deep connections with several teammates. It looked very nice.
I had a buddy in town plus the super bowl so I didn't get a chance to look at anything

@suckatsports Head to head is not the singular deciding factor in what determines the greatest of all time, but to be the man, you gotta beat the man. Mahomes had a chance to do it and he came up short. Unless he eventually beats Brady in the Super Bowl, this will hang over him in GOAT talks.
America 🇺🇸!!! How much longer will it take for you to realize the Monday after the Super Bowl 🏟 needs to be a holiday! Call national hangover day idc, just make it happen!
It’s one thing to watch the Super Bowl even bet on TB bc he’s so good. But I’m SCREAMING at y’all posting his pics like he’s a hero when he’s a maga supporter and you just had a pic of Treyvon Martin up two days ago. Use ur brains.
f a super bowl, we’re that much closer to baseball season now 🤩🤩

@sluikartinfo @jennyst0 Played 20 seasons.Went to Superbowl 10 times.Won the Superbowl 7 times.I’d say he is one of the GOAT athletes in any sport. Of course the skills won’t translate to any other sport. But try and compare these stats to any skill area such as Grammys and Oscars, they are exceptional.

Wow what a great day. Brady won yet another Super Bowl and Tesla bought $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin
who won the super bowl? no i’m kidding don’t tell me i’d rather just not know

The kid is other worldly but sometimes people lose and the insane offense shenanigans rarely show up the in the Super Bowl. I mean 2007 Tom Brady for example. That O-Line was turnstiles (including the all pro Matt Light)

14 points that night. It's a team effort for a reason.

@LeBatardShow hey according to my father Tom Brady has as much to do with this Super Bowl as a fly helping a farmer.
I'm just happy you got to perform at a superbowl and that you gave it all you got. The extra stuff like firework's, stage, change of clothes, flying, etc blah blah. All that is extra. I appreciate that you sang with passion and gave it your all. Much love and positivity. XOTWOD
Lol. But all folks are talking about today is "brady's the goat". 
I generally despise this about sports media. 1 guy doesn't play a super bowl, forget 10. 🤐🤫

Waiting for that “x amount of people got COVID from the super bowl” statistic now lol
@_EriqnHD Nah I was bsn but most accomplished is Serena easy bc she’s played in a lot more tourneys and matches than Brady... Super Bowl once a year. Tennis has 4 grand slams a year
@cleezzyy It was more entertaining than the Super Bowl 💜💜
No sabía que Capulina había cantado en el #SuperBowl 😂😂 https://t.co/5SGzRBiW1c
Statistically speaking, Brady did little to change the Bucs, who were 3rd in the NFL in points scored last year and only scored 2 ppg more this season. And he certainly didn’t change the defense, which is what won the team the Super Bowl. A winning attitude was his intangible.
You know the rest.....

@MylesUdland This might be somewhat prosaic but young people look at the super bowl as an excuse to drink and party. Watching it at a bar is a growing trend. I don’t really hear them talk about watching it for the commercials.
there were really thousands of fans actually at that super bowl? No social distancing and probably WO masks???? In case y’all forgot I HATE.especially FB players they’re the freaking worst. high school, college, pro they expect the world to revolve around them ITS GROSS
Family, Friends, Food, and Football! Super Bowl Sunday from home and not the Stadium for the first time since 2014 but enjoyed having the day off and alongside my Fiance, hosting, entertaining and having #GoodTimes w/the Fam throughout the game night #SBLV #MiamiNights #MiamiLife https://t.co/MPOyn8vQAO
instagram’s goddamn algorithm will not stop showing me super bowl pictures from 2 days ago. I’m sick of it
When Joe Biden gets booed at the Super Bowl, you might scratch your head and think, maybe the people actually didn’t vote for him?
I didn’t even drink for the Super Bowl but feel like crap today. I ate chicken wing dip even though I’m lactose intolerant and my stomach isn’t doing too hot. Losing my ability to eat cheese has been arguably the worst part of my 20’s.
@MikeTaylorShow @theweeknd My issues is that for the Super Bowl Halftime Show.  I want a big name, and while @theweeknd was good.  To me at this time he does not have that history built up yet.

No one can deny that the @Chiefs just did not show up and play like a super bowl team. I don’t wanna hear any slander about how they refs handed the bucs that game. Maybe try scoring points with someone other than your kicker 😂

@treymabrey @MichelobULTRA @Buccaneers Please provide examples of how they "cheated" to get to the Superbowl.
@MagicJohnson You talking about watching history Superbowl 55?  Or a NBA game.  Brady did good.  The Tamoa defense awesome.
@Rothitup That commercial was beautiful. Jeep definitely had a message with that one. I applaud them for using their one Super Bowl commercial to spread an amazing message.

Don’t want people to have Super Bowl parties? Don’t have the Super Bowl. It’s really quite simple. We aren’t having concerts or festivals right now, so why is football allowed? This isn’t rocket science.
According to @ESPNStatsInfo , before last nights Super Bowl, @PatrickMahomes had 17 TDs vs 0 Interceptions when blitzed.

@TimRigg01644817 @chrislhayes Who ever said bad calls never happen? Not just 1.

The story that is not being told is that this officiating crew literally shattered Superbowl records for penalties IN A GAME in just one half.

When refs become the game and are breaking penalty records they're out of control.

If you think they’re not willing to sell the farm for a QB that has proven he can play at an MVP level, you’re delusional.

When the #Eagles trade Wentz this week, they will get two 1st Round picks and a player.

Tom Brady has more Super Bowl wins then any NFL franchise ever with 7. That’s just some crazy shit to witness. And he’s still coming back with a chance to get 8. Ain’t no other player ever gonna pass this guy for the GOAT talk for a LONG ass time.

Shaq Barrett or Devin White could’ve won mvp but I didn’t even say brady didn’t deserve it I just said they were why Tampa won

So basically the Buccaneers took a 7-9 team and added a competent QB and won the Super Bowl. Imagine what the WFT could do by not adding Wentz
@Kfrancis09 @Tferd_7 @t_seaton5 @BMI1129 @Flani_23 I would rather have seen another team in over tampa for personal gripes. But if he made it all the way to the Super Bowl it’s kind of hard to not root for the guy.

💰(Borrowed this question from a Bucs player.)

@bicyndicalist @Craig_A_Spencer And I don't disagree with you at all about how evil they are. And you may say fuck them for holding a Super Bowl or having a season during a pandemic taking all precautions but I thank them for helping me keep my sanity after losing my partner last year during the pandemic
I’m confused, why are people just now finding out about #FreeBritney ? Was it a Super Bowl ad???
Tampa Bay is now Champa Bay. The Lightning win the Stanley Cup, the Rays went to the World Series and the Bucs win the Super Bowl in Tampa! https://t.co/sTJvIJzHMX

Such a bummer when one of your fav singers posts on their IG story video of them at a super crazy crowded bar watching the Super Bowl and no masks in sight...wtf
I don’t care who we sign or get rid of during the off-season. It takes some luck and being healthy to win another super bowl.

Man after watching the Super Bowl, I’m starting to open up to the idea of going OL/DL at 4... what good does a high powered offense do if we can’t get a throw off... and seeing how the D line attack Mahomes, that would be key for our defense

Good morning/afternoon to everyone in the city of Tampa. You are once again a Super Bowl city! 😎
If the Eagles are trading Wentz can someone tell me again why Pederson had to go? What a train wreck. It feels like a decade since their Super Bowl win. #FlyEaglesFly
Y’all think we are just doomed? So much love for Brady. So much hate for Brady. So much love for the Bruce “Middle” ad. So much hate for the Bruce “Middle” ad. Snark. Hate. Snark. Hate. Repeat. We can’t even enjoy Super Bowl Sunday anymore. I think everyone is gonna die angry.

#ChiefsKingdom stop already. @Chiefs defense played dirty all season you really thought they were gonna let you do it to Tom Brady in the Superbowl? You didn't show up and got your ass kicked, don't blame the refs. Be better, you're supposed to be professionals.
The best Super Bowl Halftime show was in 1993... go look it up! 🤙🏽🔥

Tom Brady really took a BUCS team that was bad last season and made them superbowl Champs in one season.  GOAT.

Not calling u a hypocrite
@Daxelinho @PFF Lamar didn’t make the super bowl. Big difference.
I’m not going to sit here and act like I’ve been an angel during this pandemic... I’ve went out, had parties, etc. But my roommate was in Tampa over the weekend for the super bowl and after watching her Snapchat stories.... this girl needs to live in a bubble for the next month.
After seeing videos of all the events surrounding the @SuperBowl in Tampa, including, the game itself, is that this country values sports more than lives.
Is it normal that after every years Super Bowl performance I watch lady Gaga’s immediately to cleanse myself from the disappointment 💀
I slept in the bathroom and I cried like a baby when we won it. Super Bowl champs and it feels so good #GoBucs

After last night's super bowl the @NFL has decided to officially declare an alternate 12th position on offense. That position is the @TomBrady. You can field a TB in lieu of a QB so long as that player has 7 SB rings(1 of which has to be a different conference).

my papaw is 82 and just got his second shot of the covid vaccine and it’s all he can talk about. He keeps saying “you better get it as soon as you can, everyone needs to get it.”

He was way more excited about the vaccine than the super bowl and that man LOVES sports.
@bicyndicalist @Craig_A_Spencer Say you don't get it first of all what Tailgaters you're not allowed to tailgate at the Super Bowl and do you make the same judgments about the protests here in Portland? Because I'm at those as well and I'm simply just not going to be a hypocrite
Yesterday was the Super Bowl?
Alright, let’s get to the Bears next overwhelming QB mistake. Super Bowl is over.
@bicyndicalist "that gave us more work" key word is "GAVE" as in already happened. The Super Bowl was just last night. Hypocrisy I hate you will never find me being a hypocrite. Does health care workers we're safer there than at work if we're to be real. They were up in the suites

Re: the Super Bowl half time show. I actually liked the set, but the Weekend's music doesn't lend itself well to the high-energy of the Super Bowl, it could have used much better and more precise choreography, and he looked like a coked-out 70's porn star which didn't help either

@purplebuckeye I don’t think anyone other than Mahomes gets KC to the second round of the playoffs, so by this logic, no QB can win a Super Bowl. This is such weird logic.

Nathan MacKinnon is washed.

Jameis Winston would have done this exact thing. Yall just didn't give him time 😂😂😂😂😂 #bucsnation #SuperBowl
@corychung Stop it sir. Arguably one of the best defensive performance in a super bowl from the Bucs D. Held a high flying offense to 9 points.
@hapamama80 @mmpadellan Kaepernick went to a SuperBowl and blew a comeback even with the gift of a blackout. The difference between him and Brady isn’t privilege, it’s talent.

If you were getting together snacks for the Super Bowl yesterday before the game, you should know that the NHL threw the CBJ into a pit and gave them the hose.
So who watched this superbowl halftime lol 😂
So proud of all you guys that got to perform at the super bowl ! I had no clue ! @chazmoneyy @albanus_thierry
My son and I talking about the super bowl and he was fed up with the Chiefs offense. 

“The Quarterback was throwing it and they couldn’t catch it, I don’t understand why they played so poorly”

The way he was talking I thought buddy placed a bet on the game 😭😭😭
Am I the only one who was genuinely satisfied with @theweeknd Super Bowl performance? Maybe it’s because I hadn’t seen a concert in almost 2 years but damn for a concert in the middle of a pandemic and the restrictions I thought he fucking killed it
There’s people out there really saying it is racist for Tom Brady to win the super bowl during the month of February 😂

I did not like the half time show. And no that does not mean I don’t “understand” The Weeknd’s music. I actually know and like quite a few of his songs. It was just an extremely lackluster performance to me. 🤷🏽‍♀️ #weeknd #HalftimeShow2021 #SuperBowl

@mandzlaughter 100%, sports shouldn’t even be going on in my opinion and to make matters even worse is that grocery stores were still offering the same bulk deals that they run every super bowl and restaurants reopened. so it’s very hard to draw the line btwn right and wrong
I'm so sick of town fucking Brady every fucking team he's already against a fucking ring mother fucking need to go head on an retire, old ass mother fucker must have sold his soul or something.#SuperBowlLIV #SuperBowl #KansasCity. This is what brought me back to Twitter.

Preparation. How often did we hear Tom Brady talk about that in the weeks leading up to the #SuperBowl? I felt like that's all he spoke of...and look how that worked in his favor! Put in the time, watch it pay off.

   Especially with a Full Stadium

Congratulations to QB Tom Brady on winning his 7th Super Bowl title and 5th S.B. MVP award. Brady is now tied with the city of Cleveland at 7 championships overall.

@concretekowboi I know a few people saw them on their run in like 2015 said instrumentally they sound fine but that Vince just doesn’t have it anymore. My advocation would be for a band like Pearl Jam but I don’t think they have stadium type production sets to make a super bowl crowd happy

If the chiefs somehow end up in the SuperBowl again next year, they can’t lose.

@mandzlaughter totally get this, but i think a majority of the blame is to be put on the gov. the super bowl itself was a super spreader, but so is reopening schools without proper vax rollouts. they’re pushing opening up the economy which is leading people to believe life can go back to normal
I don't trust wealthy ppl.

In the end they are wealthy from the status quo of America's politics and economy.

@BleacherNation Based partly on what I observed during the Super Bowl, this seems like not the best idea, but I'm also assuming that more people will have been vaccinated by the time spring training games begin
@Encorkiller Naw fam. Chiefs 100% lost. But first half was the most disgusting officiating I’ve seen in the super bowl. Could of been a way better game &amp; as a fan I feel disrespected.

Loved the #SuperBowl Jeep ad, featuring #Springsteen, saying it's time for the country to "Meet in the middle."  Also loved the Bucs' win because
 1. I love #TomBrady (declined a White House invite in 2018)
 2. Bucs played a marvelous game 3. Josh #Hawley's team was humiliated

Best ad of the Super Bowl. 

I didn’t watch any of the game. Yet the @reddit ad was the only ad I heard anything about during or after the game. https://t.co/FV5OfGk68r
In the last 13 months LSU won the natty and the Bucs won the super bowl and the Lighting won the Stanley cup and i also got married. Not too shabby
Hate him or love him...... 10 Super Bowls and 7 Rings solidifies @TomBrady as the best QB to ever play the game..... Switching teams and instantly taking them to a Super Bowl win is immeasurable. https://t.co/n0jI1cTyAP
So based on my calculations:

Raiders and Chiefs are both non Super Bowl winners. They split their match up, Raiders outscored them by 4 points. 

Conclusion: Raiders better than Chiefs in 2020! #RAIDERNATION https://t.co/B8NGVRC7fe
Had a Great Wknd - Won $400 at the casino and boo and I won $1700 in #SuperBowl Squares! 🙏🏼🙌🏽 Lovvee it!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️☺️☺️☺️☺️

Not everything was Mahomes' fault, however, as the Tampa Bay Buccaneers pressured the Chiefs into a nightmare at Raymond James Stadium.
@CFBONFOX @CalFootball @StanfordFball @GatorsFB @NDFootball @TexasTechFB @GeorgiaFootball @HuskerFBNation @MemphisFB Where is Michigan on this list. I think they have a QB that has scored a lot of TDs in the Super Bowl.

@legiiit_tcw Ok. I mean if you had a second and third string offensive line who couldn't block shit but yeah we'll blame the quarterback whose only lost five games in the last two seasons and that includes postseason and Super Bowl. All I was saying is it proves that it wasn't his fault

Was yesterday a dream? 

Nope! Brady won another Super Bowl 💍 💍💍💍💍💍💍

Have a good day
@JohnFetterman @ALeague88 Said it before, min wage is part of the problem. We need to emphasize financial literacy workshops as much as we do Super Bowl commercials. If people have basic understanding of how to save, invest, that would help a ton.

Valiant effort on my part the day after the home team wins the super bowl. One of these years I’ll get some sense and take the day off. 😂
This best summarizes it for Mahomes. Plus I would include his line didn’t show up either. Wow 🤯 No disrespect to the Bucs. They took care of business with their defense and Brady’s execution as a QB. #SuperBowl https://t.co/Z0Ff9T92Ff
Biggest eye roll today has been reading opinions on the Super Bowl halftime show from people who are not even remotely involved in the entertainment or music industry whatsoever. A million dollars says in a year they’ll be like, “I like this Weeknd guy, ever heard of him?” 🙄🙄🙄
Received an amazing box in the mail today from my super groovy friend @jonlionfineart2. He HANDMADE me this incense burner out of a branch! A freekin tree branch! I will cherish it! Thank you for the shirt and stickers and the album bowl! So much love in one box! #ThankYou ❤️😊🌈 https://t.co/jPHwncxqhT
@Nicktrent31 @stoolpresidente Not the Super Bowl rings, don’t be silly. Russell Wilson will win another ring before Patrick does btw.
For some reason there are people who are acting like the @Patriots won the Superbowl last night.
It's the @Patriots fans. Wake up. @TomBrady won, NOT you. You get zero credit.

This year I finally had the realization:

Everyone thinks the Super Bowl Halftime Show is supposed to be just for them. 🤪
china was able to limit deaths &amp; reintroduce outdoor events like concerts, which were accused of being staged propaganda events

meanwhile the US had a super bowl w 25k attendees on a day where 1301 people died .

I'm going to say this once, and once only if the Superbowl can have 25,000 attendees and the NBA All-Star games  held in Atlanta, Georgia, I best be having a commencement ceremony on May 16, 2021; that's the tweet. 💯 Congratulations Tampa Bay @Buccaneers!!

Seeing all of the people in attendance at the Super Bowl and those partying in the streets afterward reminded me of school sports being emphasized while the arts were facing cuts. My industry has been shut down this entire pandemic. Why are sports special while the arts suffer?
The Super Bowl was a joke The game stunk Why- Because the officials were not consistent in there calls on the field Pass interference on KC was not interference on Tampa and on and on So you can clearly see Tampa Bay won the game because the Officials were Biased https://t.co/cPmOi5FAmC
Tom Brady in his 40s might be a HOF career. 3 Super Bowl appearances, 2 rings, 1 MVP. Fucking ridiculous
@AStratelates Yeah, the Monday after Superbowl Sunday should be a national holiday.

@StevenBeschloss Before anyone gives @TomBrady a trophy, don’t forget that the Chiefs have the right to exhaust every legal avenue to challenge the result. It would be irresponsible to congratulate the Buccaneers so early. Many many fans are upset. Wouldn’t want them to lose trust.#SuperBowl

3-11 for 36 yards and an interception! The audacity people have blaming Shanahan for last year’s Super Bowl when his QB pulled that bullshit is insane https://t.co/Yz9QVf0QU9
@patsfan485 @ugandasjoy01 This one takes the cake. That super bowl matchup is simply inconceivable!

The only acceptable time to say “I was born in the wrong era.” is if you are referring to not being alive to see Whitney Houston’s January 27th, 1991 Super Bowl performance of the National Anthem.
@EliManning wanted to know where you rank in NFL history..bro...your labeled the “magnificent greatest”quarterback to ever beat the greatest quarterback in NFL history twice &amp; thanks to you..he doesn’t have 9 SUPERBOWL rings but all due respect..congratulations to Tom Brady.
@Buccaneers I'm so proud of my Tampa Bay Bucs. Congratulations on winning Super Bowl 55. You guys played an amazing game. Especially the defense! Shout out to #58 @ShaquilBarrett . You had the Mahomes running all over the field. I can't wait till next season. Go Bucs!!! 💯

@egoldie80 #YoAnthony Favorite Super Bowl food/snack.
The fact that every year the Super Bowl halftime show produces an onslaught of memes goes to show that they keep picking the wrong acts...or are they?
It's a post-Super Bowl, tipsy pod today and we're talking: 
- Tom Brady
- Rating The Weeknd’s performance - What you could buy instead of a 2021 Super Bowl ad
- Robinhood &amp; Vlad
- Renaissance's $5 billion in redemptions
+ MORE

Breaking news, this just in. Tom Brady is going to be traded to the Jacksonville jaguars and they’re going to win the Super Bowl next year.

@nikosleverenz Also, I need to add it was refreshing to see the refs officiate properly. Definitely making up for the horrible crew that officiated the 2020 Super Bowl.

I still don’t know who won the Super Bowl. 🤔 They did play, right?
The Tampa Bay Buccaneers won the Super Bowl. It finally hit me.

What the #SuperBowl taught me, the Mahomes family doesn’t take criticizing very well
2021 Super Bowl was a joy to watch. Brady put on a football master class, and the Bucs D shut down the most physically gifted QB in NFL history. I can’t stop thinking about how great of a football game that was to witness. And I can’t wait to rewatch it on NFL Network every year.
My Super Bowl party was very small compared to past years but I had such a good time
@plays_w_knives SUPER BOWL THROWBACK.
Idk how getting Gordon, AB, Sanu and attempting to draft a wr over 2 years is pushing a player away lmao. Hate to break it to you Dov but last superbowl Pats won wasn't bc of Brady even tho he's the Goat that game was all the  defense saving the team. Its a team sport. https://t.co/VMTx3kOoGQ
Everyone and they moms was performing at the super bowl orrr????? Someone gotta be lying lmaoooo

So... does anyone have a @TomBrady jersey I can borrow? I lost my Super Bowl bet to @KayceSmith and will be wearing his jersey in my avi for the next year...

@AishaAnnHakim Hmmm. Not sure about that.

Super Bowl is one of the last truly mass media events. Almost none left.

Can quibble with their methodology (who is voting?) but what that audience thinks matters. Doesn't mean they're always right, but it's a mistake to assume they're wrong.

@james_keh @theStevenRuiz @RealMNchiefsfan Especially with the second and third string offensive line that's what the difference is that he's playing here FYI and has been media fodder for the entire week leading up to the Super Bowl

@SuperBowl :Found it odd that the network, announcers and half time crew all were pulling for Mahomes. He could do no wrong, had a sore toe. Brady could do no right. Refs were hard on Mahomes. The whole thing, game, half time show, announcers, joined for BLM agenda.

Enjoy y'all's Super Bowl win, y'all don't run the NFC South.
So many things sad about this: One is that no substances were likely consumed to the point he wouldn’t remember doing this. Two is his dunceness went down at the 1/2 yard line thus didn’t score #wordsofmoss #Superbowl

2021 Superbowl engagement was the most disengaged year, ever for me; I was more engaged the year the Dallas Texas Superbowl was snowed out...

@mark99784809 @jennybizh @thomaskaine5 Separating emotions from fact: Brady won his 7th Super Bowl decidedly by completing 21 passes for 3 touchdowns. Nothing to do with the PPP money. The performance was blah. Paying the dancers is wonderful, but doubt that many people know that.
Can’t believe Gronkowski and Brady just won a super bowl with the Bucs.   Unreal.
@HunterMahan @PSchrags The "trust the process" hubris displayed by Green Bay's front office is astounding. Almost 20 years of watching bad Bucs football while the Packers have transitioned from one Hall of Fame QB to another, and TB just matched GB's Super Bowl count in that span by going all in.

As good as it can be then we lost the super bowl but I had a feeling that's what was going to happen there's too many people closed to Brady for him to be loosing.smh but I'm still a fan of my team for life. Win or loose they're still my team https://t.co/rLEeq1eqxi

@CecilyTynan It actually entertained me more than I expected, because my expectations were low. I personally don’t think his career has risen to ‘super bowl status’ yet 🤷🏻‍♀️.
Jonathan you can kick their butt anytime but please start off with Brady. I can't stand him he's arrogant I can't stand him he's so arrogant. And of course Netflix is doing a  documentary on him. And wow he won the super bowl what a nice addition to his documentary SMH https://t.co/1sinqoMZw1

@shermanation51 @JimCosta_ Exactly. Whole point is you need a good D to make the Super Bowl. Niners D was dominant during Montanas run but he gets his deserved credit. Brady did what was needed to win and threw 3 TDs and didn't do anything to lose the game.
This is incredible content. So often, responses to Super Bowl ads are cliche. Not this one. All of us in higher ed social media management should take note! This is seizing the moment. https://t.co/GmpxfLW1Yh

No way. Joe Montana never lost a super bowl. Brady has lost three. That’s three more losses than Montana’s who never lost one. Can’t be the 🐐 if he’s lost a championship game when there are other legendary qbs that haven’t ever lost the big game. https://t.co/cEDBs6AfTF

Super Bowl is literally maybe the 3rd or 4th football game she’s watched, and I explain what’s happening as it happens... Shes caught on so quickly and it’s been a lot of fun! The analysis is spot on too 👊🏼
Watching football with someone who is new to the game can be pretty fun! 

Some of my girlfriend’s analysis/observations during the Super Bowl last night ⤵️

- White pants (Chiefs) are kind of frustrating to watch. They seem immature and like they didn’t even prepare for this...
Patrick Mahomes' mom. #SuperBowl https://t.co/0jIJUBxJaE
Won $600 from the super bowl 🤑🤑🤑
It sucked bad enough to lose the Superbowl but now we get to enjoy Canadian weather for a week. Lucky us 🙄😠
I did not watch the super bowl yesterday because I do not care about sports BUT if someone who did watch could send me all the best commercials that would be great
Twitter really calling @TomBrady a racist for winning the Superbowl during black history month😭😭
My nephew and anak on Superbowl Sunday🏈🏈🏈 I love these 2 so much💙💙 https://t.co/2KnvjKTgsS
if i already don’t like you and you come up to me within the next couple of days talking about the super bowl i’m rocking your shit
@wryancraig @crupicrupicrupi @TVGrimReaper @TVvInce @LouDCommLLC @maskedscheduler Well, seriously,regarding other networks, given the softness of the past few years, if this figure is off enough it will have to enter into the long range plans of all the Super Bowl Networks. It could impact plans to the tens of millions...
@tdurkin34 @mike_e_kaye I agree, &amp; I also used the "anointed" tag on him today too. The networks wanted him to be the next Brady. Yes, he's great, but one bad season &amp; big injury &amp; he may never sniff a super bowl again let alone 7 times. as an @Eagles fan since 1980 SB 41 yrs ago,  nothing is a given. https://t.co/qwJgi5Uj7W
@paolohu I guess my point is that most people tend to agree with you, and I hope you are right.  My perspective is not ridiculous, however and no one seems to question him.  Whisenhunt took Cards from laughingstock to Super Bowl snd people wanted to run him out of town...
I know nothing of how long Super Bowl games are.  What time PDT did CBS switch over to regular programming?  Are they still doing post-game show?
There was one play in the super bowl I remember, ball was reflected, popped up and intercepted by KC, that lady ref called it incomplete, looking for that video
@mvpWRLD @PlayoffMcLaurin My fandom basically started during that first Pats super bowl because my whole family was rooting against them, so I wanted to be a rebel 😂 the other Boston area teams followed suit in the next couple years

@Outkick @ClayTravis Or play the Super Bowl on a Saturday night. The ratings for a 7 pm ET Saturday night kickoff would be literally through the roof.

@MenInKiltsSTARZ I’m so embarrassed, I’m so silly, in the middle of the Super Bowl I was checking to see what time it’s over so I can watch Men in Kilts. Course, of course I’ve got the date wrong it’s next Sunday. Darn!!!  Can’t wait.

Serena Williams is the greatest athlete of all time and until Tom Brady wins a Super Bowl while pregnant, I won’t debate with you.

@NFL_Memes Well because Boston is locked down first of all and he is their “Messiah”, so they will watch. Tampa Bay Area is not locked down. Sport bars are open holding 35-40 people per TV (which is isn’t counted). Plus we could goto the Super Bowl which would in turn, lower the numbers. https://t.co/udDK53YXwO

My theory about the super bowl is that the Chiefs were rusty bc the starters had played only one game (against the Browns) since mid-December. That’s one game in 6 weeks prior to the super bowl. That’s not enough to keep sharp in a game situation.
Tom Brady really took the sorry ass Bucs to the super bowl and won 🤣🤣

And before the kneeling “controversy”, he was supplanted by a QB named: Blaine Gabbert (who just won a Super Bowl, as Tom Brady’s backup). The NFL is a cutthroat league.
My mom, bless her heart, is very fired up about the Weeknd's Super Bowl Halftime show. Whether you liked it or not, I can't imagine being this upset about it. I never want to get old. https://t.co/Ct1xQ0pvwS
I know folks are upset about the Bruce Springsteen Super Bowl ad, but I’m equally bothered by Volvo use for a Pete Seeger Union organizing song to push their car.
The #NFL would likely rather everyone not know how bad it was.

I’m 49 years old and have never missed watching a #SuperBowl since I can remember as a kid.  I watched zero minutes of of the pre/game/post broadcast. The outcome was predictable and 1/2  hasn’t been good in years https://t.co/tZPOw8Renz

@Franklin_Graham You are 100% correct, Reverend Graham. The Super Bowl half-time show made absolutely no sense - - Just people running around the field. What happened to musical presentations? Many in our country have lost their way, evidently.

@Chiefs Damn right! Tom Brady didn’t win every super bowl starting out. We weren’t disappointed in you guys. Never could be. Keep your heads up! See you next year 🔥❤️✨

The Patriots went a decade before they won the Super Bowl again during their 20 year run. They made the playoffs each season except one in 2008 but they were always contenders. The Chiefs will be contenders every year for the next 12 seasons but no guarantee they are a dynasty.

Tom Brady Beat Aaron Rodgers and the PACKERS in the NFC CHAMPIONSHIP Game, then Beat Patrick Mahomes and the CHIEFS in the SUPERBOWL!  Rodgers and Mahomes might need to Switch from STATE FARM to ALLSTATE to Protect Themselves from MAYHEM like Tom Brady!  #AfterSUPERBOWLThoughts https://t.co/bSUbLNJuT2

After winning his 10th superbowl ring Tom Brady retires from the NFL and signs with expansion XFL San Antonio Commanders Brings home the title!
Went to @LoyolaChicago - worked @Cubs - I was 8 when @ChicagoBears won super bowl - I think @ForwardMSNFC puts on a great show. Otherwise it's a when in Rome thing, I like experiencing game day anywhere! https://t.co/8bodWc8oMD
The #SuperBowl bump for the “Weekend” is working nicely.  6 of the top 10 on iTunes Charts so far.
I’m just starting to recover mentally from the 1 for 13 day I had yesterday on Super Bowl props
@thehill @TheHillOpinion And Kansas City should have showed up and won the SUPER BOWL!
#golions I guess with the super bowl being yesterday it was good not really good not a close game I almost fell asleep watching it but it made me get up and get to the gym fast today #mondayworkout #mondaymotivation https://t.co/YGVWRHiyv0
@avi_langer @DougPolkVids My bad, rushed that one out. Here's a cleaner version. 

"Wow, didn't realize the CRITIC sources of Super Bowl half time show performances included Doug Polk.

Kinda like ordering Chinese food at McDonalds."

Hope that helps.
Just saw the video of me being arrested on the @NowThisPolitics Instagram page comparing the protests in Tampa to the super bowl riots and I’m in tears. I try really hard to not let it get to me but I’m still fucking facing FELONY charges.
@AURELIO_XCV This reminds me of Coldplay’s Super Bowl performance. They’re not for everyone, and I will admit, their performance wasn’t like their concerts BUT they still did pretty well. The Weeknd did a dope ass job And I applaud the visuals and the transitions between songs

Everybody a Leonard fan now since that man won the super bowl, can’t stand New Orleans people bro 😂
@mrbballin I thought it was a great Super Bowl! Watched a superb defense shut down one of the most talented QBs to ever play. And because Mahomes is so good, ya never knew if he would come back. Great watch.
I had a flight credit and bought a flight for $11 and used my super bowl winnings to book my rental car. Five day trip for $14 ain’t bad at all!
The best Super Bowl halftime performance of all time. Nothing can, or will ever, compare. https://t.co/eduIyXs8oV
Mahomes was actually amazing, but it takes the offense, defense, special teams, coaches, and front office to come come through to win the Super Bowl. No excuses when another team outperforms you. https://t.co/gAt32iFUXw
https://t.co/XgtbebX7YH
The only thing my fam loves more than the Super Bowl are sensationalized claims of satan being in cahoots with whoever performed the halftime show
This isn’t a justified comparison lmao. There’s 1 Super Bowl a year. There’s MULTIPLE major competitions for Tennis yearly. It’s hard to justify this comparison when the games are so vastly different https://t.co/rSyj55bSN4
I’m a big Chiefs fan. Not only am I sure the Super Bowl was rigged I don’t trust the score. Dead people must have scored touchdowns. Some people must have scored twice or even more often. I protest the score so it shouldn’t count

You think when Aaron Rodgers films a super bowl commercial he knows he’s gonna get to watch it at home?

Saying the refs had anything to do with the Bucs winning the SuperBowl is lazy and tiresome. 
Refs had nothing to do with the chiefs defense getting dominated or their offense being lackluster or their coaching staffing being out-schemed. Yall just hate to see Thomas Brady win 🤷🏾‍♂️
Hot Take: Patrick Mahomes  low-key had the best sophomore slump second full season and lost the Superbowl after just winning

Like I literally could not care less if they posted about the protests vs the super bowl riots but to use that video of me? Several times?? And then not say shit about my current situation? It’s disrespectful asf.
@tribelaw They are actually happy for Brady. Brady wanted more 🤑 Brady wanted more control and to make Giselle happy in a warm 🥵 climate. Like some New Englanders he moved to Florida when he got older. He will be back when he enters the Hall of Fame. After his 10th Superbowl ring ❤️

@KBatey2 @tootgail Perhaps you're unaware that anyone who attended the Superbowl had to test negative &amp; show proof of that negative test within 72 hours prior to gain entry.

I threw in $20 into a squares bet on the Super Bowl with my brother and his rich friends. The pot was up to $200! Long story short, I won the 3rd and 4th quarter purses of $125 altogether lol. Well, technically $105 but yay :) that felt good :) https://t.co/VBmLgZbhT1

@BrusselsParking @tomflood1 I didn’t see the original, but I’m 99% certain he used the Jeep Super Bowl commercial as the base. As per @tomflood1 creatives, he leaves some of the original in to show how absolutely absurd their commercial looks/sounds compared to unarmored humans and a burning planet.
@cam_harden @YouKnow_Jay11 Never thought I’d be pulling for him in a super bowl but I sure was last night lol
@vaeanthoni But for the most part all superbowl winning teams have probably like a top 12 defense.  I don't think we'll  see a QB completely carry a team that was like bottom 15 ranked in O and D. QB is also the position across the 4 major sports with the most weight to it IMO
@delia_cruzkelly 😂 so truuuuueeeeee 

I remember turning it on in another room of a house I was at with my mom for a Super Bowl party 😅
@TedH6 Except for Montana beat bigger names than anybody.Mahomes is the biggest name Brady beat,McNabb,J.Delomme,Russ,M.Ryan.Montana beat K.Andersen, Boomer,J.Elway, &amp; Dan Marino.Joe NEVER threw an INT in a Super Bowl.That’s a better resume

@EvaninSEA Just watched super bowl 49 again for the first time since the biggest choke in @NFL history. Still can’t believe that goal line play. @Seahawks might never recover from that.

Tbh I feel like Taylor won’t do the super bowl for a few years. Only because she still won’t have reputation re-recorded and there’s some song I feel she’d definitely play at a show like that.

@minakimes @minakimes the kid played 2 of his 3 worse games of his career in the super bowl.   If your going to say it was coaching or because missing his line.  Then why not give the same respect to other QB's when there missing there Left tackle? Or has worse coach in the NFL. Be fair

As a Vikings Fan the great lesson we learned in the Super Bowl. Contrary to SKOL North’s theory. A highly talented QB cannot win you a Super Bowl with an underperforming OL. Kirk cousins can win a SB with an above average OL and an Elite Def with the talent they currently have.

Someone explain to me like a child why it’s okay for a team to have home-field advantage in a Super Bowl. The #NFL should have swapped stadiums with next years host. It’s a massive advantage to sleep in your bed and it’s no wonder the Bucs got every call at home.
@iglen31 Colston, Michael Thomas, Alvin Kamara, Brandin Cooks, Duece McCallister Reggie Bush, and do I need to start with his O-line? All to make 1 Super Bowl? It’s not like Brees made 7 and lost to better teams but he played great. He had great teams and constantly fell short lol

96.4 million viewers for Super Bowl includes a record shattering 5.7 million on streaming. Big uptick there (streaming had never crossed 4 million for a Super Bowl). TV-only still north of 90 million. Super Bowl hasnt dipped below 90 million on TV since Pats-Eagles in 2005

Overheard:

   The Kansas City Chiefs have reportedly retained Jay Sekulow to represent them in a federal legal challenge to the 2021 Super Bowl results. They plan to prove that the scoreboard manufacturer surreptitiously switched Chief points to the Bucs costing them the game.
And the mainstream media rushed to condemn OUTDOOR gatherings in Florida as “super spreader events,” ignoring the millions of people coaxed into HOUSEHOLD gatherings for the Super Bowl in LA and NYC

I’m so eager for common sense and data to prevail over politics and priors
The “leaders” of LA and NYC did almost everything they could to ensure people watched the Super Bowl in household gatherings, even though data shows that’s exactly where the majority of Covid spreads

We’re a year into this and so many failed Covid policies are still just stupid
A strong argument as the greatest coach to never reach a Super Bowl.
Brady has played Jared Goff and Patrick Mahomes since losing to Nick Foles in the Super Bowl.

@StuDoesAmerica Happy Birthday Stu! You looked really good in that hot pink thong running down the field at the Super Bowl. Chamonix has definitely worked for you!
Actual footage of the Super Bowl Lolol https://t.co/eB8UwZONqM
@BleacherReport @RapSheet He ran 497 Yards to escape the pressure he was facing every play in the Super Bowl all while having a tear in his foot.

Patrick Mahomes slander is not tolerated.
@MetNeus @TheAmandaGorman From the #whitehouse to the #SuperBowl @TheAmandaGorman poetry is heard and recognized.
Now stop #hating . This is her #moment &amp; #time .
I really wish cable news would stop hyping the Impeachment trial like it’s the Super Bowl. Looking at you, deep-voiced CNN announcer guy.
A super bowl during a pandemic 👎🏽

Did you enjoy the 2021 super bowl performances? Who did you like most and why?
@JeremyWGR @steveowen91 Yeah I'm not arguing the logistics here. I know it's pretty needed. NCAA is maybe a bad example by myself. But I still think the super bowl game is unnecessary.
@GM You get best Super Bowl ad in my book #NoWayNorway 😍😍♥️
The last Quarterback to throw a Super Bowl Touchdown against Tom Brady is still Nick Foles. https://t.co/crYSfjMmx2
@Cadillac My favorite super bowl commercial
@anylaurie16 Just listened to your podcast. Your fancy TV can get free broadcasts (yes, like the Super Bowl or your local news) by plugging in a $15-30 antenna you can get at Target!!!!
@Coachtoddbowles @Buccaneers congratulations and thank you for making us the city of Super Bowl Champions, respect from a Giants fan and lifelong Elizabeth resident #kissthering
@nrarmour We literally just had a Super Bowl with two “retread” head coaches and this is how people still think 🤷‍♀️🥲🤦🏻‍♂️

@BirdGangPHI @SmittyBarstool Yep. Super Bowl Champion Nick Foles. Wentz will never sniff a ring for himself. Foles won him the only one he’ll ever get.
Incredible super bowl moment for the one guy on our street with a snow blower.
When the cameras were off and the chips were down, @PatrickMahomes showed his character. When he was pressed about the Super Bowl refs and his offensive line, he delivered again. https://t.co/mEsZwT7GTD

@LiMilla4 @ashishkjha @TaylorPopielarz @JaneCastor had a set perimeter around the Super Bowl events but not the whole of Tampa which would have required the RNC staffing event levels; I would say the spread will be local more; @GovRonDeSantis is primarily to blame because he prohibits enforcement of mandates.

I tweeted to Levi just after the Eagles won Super Bowl 52. 

Just before I got in my car to drive to Dick’s in KOP to buy Champs gear;  I said to Levi, you were the only one back in August 2017 that said we would win it all. 
Levi was right. He smiled. I’ll never forget that. https://t.co/AnJNawDVRn
The streaker at the super bowl should go down in the history books.

Tom Brady didn’t win the super bowl The Team won the game!!
Estos conspiranoicos seguidores de Trump ven una "señal" hasta en el superbowl, habia mucho rojo según ellos .
Anybody with half a brain knew that the SB ratings would be down. Legacy media will do what they can to show it “ain’t that bad”. #SuperBowl
Not surprised at all. Probably lots of reasons but I think the lack of media AT the Super Bowl played a role. Far less talk on the news and entertainment shows about Super Bowl than past years. https://t.co/BazWDvgNyo
@dizwire @WesKinetic @KiraWire Just realized the super bowl is in LA next year too!!!  Super lit !  Let’s do this !
2 things I found incredibly impressive about the Super Bowl: 1) I managed to watch 0 football despite the TV being on and having friends over, and 2) I gained 6 pounds of food that day.  There is absolutely a correlation between the two.  I was really eating the entire time😱🤰🏻🤷‍♀️
I wonder if these companies just write off the cost of Super Bowl ads in their taxes 🤣🤣🤣🤣
@DelReid Shady just won back to back SuperBowl's. #FlyEaglesFly

@TheBroncosWire He played 5 games for DEN at QB, he went 2-3 and left the team in the offseason. BUF signed him and converted him to WR.  They traded him in 1971 to MIA where he would win 2 consecutive Superbowl rings (VII, VIII).

Ratings for the Super Bowl were off significantly in 2021, part of a season-long trend.
We let there be fans at the Super Bowl... does that mean we’ll get to walk in May?! :)
@Titmousie Absolutely! We had a taco bar for the Super Bowl so all the fixings are ready.
Isn't it funny they liked him until we lost the super bowl. He is very sincere and worked with beach and Hunt to turn his contract to keep several of our players https://t.co/M2d7kAygjW

Super Bowl LV on CBS draws audience of 96.4 million viewers; most watched SB was Patriots-Seahawks in 2015 (114.4M viewers)  https://t.co/wDZi2bnJsu
If Tom Brady switches to the Dallas cowboys and wins a superbowl then and only then will he be the goat 🤣
I get it he’s rich, loved, &amp; a Super Bowl champion. He was also a complete douche when drafted and when he was benched for being not good and overall MARGINAL QB. @EliManning you are lame, and yes your bank account wins over mine, also nepotism helps. @SarahSpain
SO HE CAN PLAY THE SUPERBOWL ON TURF TOE BUT LT COULDNT GO? YOU ARE A FRAUD LT https://t.co/A1MHbdWXUN
@Breaking911 @TampaPoliceDep @JaneCastor Mayor, be careful what you wish for. You just might find yourself at the top of the list for people not wearing a mask at the Super Bowl. Tampa PD, you heard the mayor, go and arrest her for none compliance of her own rule. https://t.co/dQmjuHWmWl
@TheLeoTerrell Viewership was down to levels reached more than a dozen years for a pretty good Super Bowl. Jeep shot blanks with it's mid-country malarkey. No one on Madison Avenue knows anything about the Heartland. Paul Ryan surely doesn't. It took a builder from Queens to figure that out.
This just continues to be proven year over year. You don’t need to pay TOP money to a RB to win a Super Bowl. Period. Last SB RB MVP was Terrell Davis in 98. https://t.co/kncfAIJ46v
@Jim_Jordan Good luck with that, alot of people who went to the super bowl are not even from the state of Florida so who in the world do they plan on pulling this off and guess what Tampa PD sure can't cross state line anyway, wow so this is how they plan on wasting tax payers money 🇺🇸👎👎

TV ratings don’t really measure audiences accurately any more.

Lots of people cut the cord a long time ago and do not watch “TV” at all.

5.7 million people were streaming the Super Bowl every minute.

In my house, we watched on Fubo. 

https://t.co/znvGLpoMDK

@MrTommyNew @TomBrady @Browns @SuperBowl I will add that today’s NFL is much more gentle on the QB product than it was back when Unitas, Staubach, or Montana was playing. I gotta say @PatrickMahomes even in losing was impressive and trying to make plays.
That's because Dallas didn't play duuuuuuuh.😂😂😂😂😂

@erikjcain @tartinm Isn’t that nuts? I think I saw this comparison in one of the ad rags during the lead up to the big show. Super Bowl spots are funny - brands either go full hog and spend as much or more on the creative, or blow their budget on the media and use crap stock.

@lhomzz Right. So mahomes didn’t have to deal with a bad offensive line or receivers that were dropping the ball all year. Why they made the super bowl. Wentz would’ve been the blame if he had the game Mahomes played. But Mahomes didn’t get 1 bit of blame. And here’s Wentz btw. https://t.co/1VpKXVyYiy

@VegasRebs @kenminster @Jeep @springsteen Maybe I’ve been working in marketing and branding for too long now, but consumers expect brands to stand for something. And ads with political undertones are almost expected now in the super bowl, so I’d much rather prefer the boss talking about meeting in the middle.

@mspears96 ... you just said “no one will look back in history at this Super Bowl and say Mahomes had no line” ...I’m confused on what’s making you think this is the only exception in HISTORY for that statement ?
I didn’t watch a single snap from the Super Bowl on Sunday. I was stuck in 3 straight Union representation hearings and I had the day trip to Alabama to plan after my shift. 

I didn’t grow up. I just learned to prioritize my time, which I’ve found out is very precious.
Super Bowl LV viewership lowest since 2007, was most streamed NFL game ever

@qbcoach18 @vabudaa1 LMAOOO YES THEY REALLY LOST TO A 43YEAR OLD #TOMBRADY  who now has seven rings and was at 10th superbowl 14th playoff  patrick need his ass whopped
Oh no we can’t have concerts but we can have 25k people at the Super Bowl
Super Bowl LV. Point of attack was a storyline. The Chicago Bears can learn a lot from TB/KC:
• Even Patrick Mahomes will struggle with offensive line issues
• Tampa Bay’s pass rush was insane. The Bears need more from Quinn/Mack/Hicks
• more: https://t.co/4fyElBuRkw
Oh and mad love to @brucehornsby 
An old ally of mine &amp; major muse

Incredible talent!
@REALEST2DOIT_25 @Bosak26 @BleacherReport @RapSheet You are a dumbass , if they won he would still get the surgery .. they said he was getting surgery after the season before the super bowl

The @vikings will hever win a Super Bowl in my lifetime so while I’m on this earth I can take solace in making fun of @packers fan. @ Burbank, California https://t.co/NVKWzYMtLN
@degen_trdr @jupp0r @NateSilver538 There were 7500 healthcare workers at the Super Bowl.

1/6 of all ICUs are still over 95% capacity and 80k people are still in hospitals for the virus. That's far below peak but still objectively bad!
@scott_fowler Marty was a heck of a head coach. although he never reached the ultimate pinnacle of winning a Super Bowl, he was one of the winningest coaches in NFL history. I will never forget his infamous words, 'Gentleman, get the gleam in your eyes' right before the 1986 AFC Championship.
Sunday night- was your family talking about the Super Bowl or BTC?
“Miss, how does it feel to know your team didn’t make it to the Super Bowl?” -3rd Grader 
Pain. All pain.
People feeding into this whole The Weeknd/Super Bowl thing. “Like you don’t know his story omg don’t say anything if you have nothing nice to say”. We just wanna laugh at some funny memes. Calm yerrrr horses geez whizz gah lee people.
@JOD1479 It's odd in all honesty, Superbowl weekend is usually crazy but this year it was dead. Everyone just sat at home minding their own business. I've seen tickets go on sale for concerts later in the year so hoping that's a good sign
@admadlad @oatly Said the exact same thing when I saw it air during the game. Was fun and smart. Thinking beyond the game. The Super Bowl was just a massive point of departure... the seed is growing. I don’t even like @oatly but respect the strategy.
Ok this is just dumb. Moved us from stage 5 to 4 then says we may go back to 5 because of super bowl parties. Why not just stay at 5 till we see.

Kids can't go to school. Father's can't go to appointments with their pregnant wives. People can't be with their dying loved ones. 

But we CAN pack 25 THOUSAND people into a football stadium for the Super Bowl. 

i’m sorry, but there’s something wrong with this picture.
Tom Brady just won 4 playoff games this season with the Super Bowl win. Lamar, Baker and Josh Allen have 4 total career playoff wins. Wow. #NFL

I understand fully why artists pay to perform at the Super Bowl. I’ve wanted nothing more than to revisit The Weeknd catalog the last few days. 

I used to be the biggest fan out of all people I know. First time I heard House of Balloons I told everybody and they momma about him
@VeniceMase Did you Hear that the  Streaker from the Super bowl put 50k that there would be a  Streaker in the super bowl...only  Cost him a 1k to bail out and took home  6 figures

The fact that the @NFL is pledging $250 mil to fight systemic racism, but has yet to apologize or make reparations to @Kaepernick7, is exactly why I did NOT watch the Super Bowl &amp; exactly why I haven’t been a supporter of American football for years.

@CupcakKe_rapper After reading a hundred coments in this thread I still have no idea who actually won the super bowl 🥴 https://t.co/JBZ9ZRZMln
If Brady had a Mahomes performance in the Super Bowl Twitter would roast him. Since Mahomes is beloved he gets excuses. #TheGoat is held to higher standards.
@robdolin Then maybe Montana would have been the first QB to be winning Super Bowl in both NFC and AFC. 
But there is a big "if".

I grew up on “Marty Ball” in the 1990’s with the Chiefs... pounding the rock on offense with Okoye and Word, rushing the passer with my favorite player Derrick Thomas and Neil Smith. He was a Mahomes away from a Super Bowl multiple times.

@Shawn86764868 @gbellseattle @Doubledown_A That’s fair. And there have been a few costly play sequences that were cringe — RW either hanging onto ball or making ill advised throws.

I still can’t believe the entire NFL let the Bucs win the stupid Super Bowl. Now that I think about I think the super bowl is rigged including last season. Kittle OPI was a joke and so were the game changing plays in the 2nd qtr.

@AngelaCruz38 @DonaldJTrumpJr The SuperBowl is over. The only advantage that Tampa Bay had was home field. Other than that the Zebras made equally bad calls in both teams favor. Players must always adjust to the way the game is being called by the officials not the other way around. K.C. and tRump both lost.

@Thekilla1999 How did u sleep knowing ur team couldn't score a damn TD in the Superbowl and straight up choke to a wild card team? 😂
@DevinWhite__40 I ordered a Super Bowl flag if I sent it to you would you be willing to sign it for me?! It would mean the world
@Thekilla1999 Then why did I go sleep happy knowing that chiefs got blown out in the biggest game of their career. 😂. 0 TD in the Superbowl bruh. Lmfao
just a daily reminder that the bucs are super bowl champs
Rams vs bills super bowl next year
@Thekilla1999 Cuz ur logic is stupid. So, was last year the first Superbowl you ever watched? Answer that
Brady winning the super bowl during black history month got nothing on wilder getting his ass beat. That ass whoooing was wayyyy worse 😭 I feel like that shit was planned

@benmaller Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. I give that Super Bowl an A+ for the Buccaneers serving up a huge piece of humble pie to the Chiefs who clearly thought the Super Bowl was a mere formality. Seeing Mahomes run for his life and the Chiefs get destroyed was peak schadenfreude.

@c4men Those are all things to consider but they don't negate the reason you should do it. Its like saying im not gonna make a trade that can get me to the Superbowl because in 3 years I'm not sure we'll make the playoffs. In the short term it's this generation version of the new deal

"Bruce Arians had plenty to say about Tom Brady a day after Super Bowl"  https://t.co/FfCxOL300c
we had, telling him, once again, I was proven correct. We laughed and dapped up each other. I was hoping to see Terez at the Super Bowl. He wound up not going. Over the past several months, the world has lost some great sportswriters and even better people. And I’ve lost friends.
losing the super bowl in a blowout, cased around the field because the o line was a turnstile, receivers dropping passes, teammates committed dumb penalties, has to deal with his Karen of a mom, his  crazy fiance, and shithead brother. No one is having a worse week than mahomes.

Todd Bowles had a genius game plan. And Goff was just in the Super Bowl so obviously he's great. But his coach? How can you call him a genius or even a good coach? Keyshawn as an analyst is about as good as he was as a receiver. Irrelevant and lacking in impact.
They say shit like this and don’t even let him or lavonte make pro bowl.. shit is so dumb.. lavonte has damn near best stats for a LB every season and never make the pro bowl.. now we win the superbowl now he the best LB in the league https://t.co/RDRtuQ1wyx

@ryan_landreth Forget the mvp, it took Dee Ford lining up offsides for him to not take his team to the Super Bowl THREE YEARS IN A ROW. What a clown.
Yet this team rose above, even when Eric Fisher - a former #1 Overall pick in the Draft - went down with his Achilles, weakening an already decimated offensive line, to advance to a 2nd consecutive Super Bowl.

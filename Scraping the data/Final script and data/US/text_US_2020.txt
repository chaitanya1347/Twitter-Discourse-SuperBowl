Do not turn the Super Bowl off just because the KC Chiefs are ahead 24 at half time. The commercials are good.

Did you guys hear the new Super Bowl rules this year? They’re only playing 3 quarters, then the last quarter won’t be timed but the first team to score 24 MORE points is declared the winner. Ya, should be pretty straightforward and Chiefs favored by 1.5. #SuperBowlLIV

The last time they went, Jack Buck was on play by play.  

This time, his 50 year old son, Joe Buck, will be on play by play.

The small good thing is Trump wanted the trial over by Super Bowl Sunday and it won't be AND at  his State of Union he will not be acquitted just IMPEACHMENT! You never know something huge could come out where Senators can NOT vote for an acquittal a Nixon moment.

@CaptPat48 Basically.  Yes.  Allen did call football but it was strictly a side hustle.  

Scully never called a Super Bowl.   He said he never had a desire to do so.   I believe him.   The last football game he called was the 1981 NFC Championship.   What a walk off THAT was!!!

Why did you sign a 2nd contract with the Bengals? This the team you said didn’t want to win a Super Bowl? Makes no sense. Maybe if you had the “mamba mentality” you would have lifted the Bengals to a Super Bowl. Carson please shut up.

@ebruenig All you people are crazy if you pick blue. Not only do you get to relive your life, you know about google, amazon and Microsoft and who wins every super bowl, World Series, Stanley cup, masters, etc. Imagine the possibilities of what you could fix or create with that knowledge
As much as I hate to say this but the @49ers have been proving me wrong all yr. Also I cant stand seeing the @Chiefs go to the super bowl just because Im a @Raiders fan, but I really did call the dumb chiefs going to the super bowl, you can't deny @PatrickMahomes gots the Talent.
It’s crazy the 69ers made it to the Super Bowl with such a horribly offensive name

Good morning Tweeterverse. I hope this is a good weekend for you. The Superbowl is on, so that's a fun activity for some.

My new favorite super bowl bet is Jimmy G having under 120.5 yards passing in the first half. 

Not sure how his game total can be 240.5 and the first half line is exactly a split of his game total when the gameplan will presumably be so run heavy to start ❓

I am more afraid of Stafford going to another team and winning a Super Bowl than taking a chance or another QB getting the Lions there. Stafford is going to be in the HOF. So if all these off the field talks and relationship issues keep getting in the way I’m stuck.
It amazes me that people don’t think this is greatest play in NFL history. He did this to win the super bowl...🤦🏿‍♂️ https://t.co/XqhrPMIdbU

Hey...if you do a $6 million dollar Super Bowl commercial pitch and it ends with, "then the guy gets hit in the crotch and we run the tagline," or "the fart is really gonna get them rolling," START OVER
@StatsOnFire @TonyDungy Much ado about nothing imo.

Chiefs' #SuperBowl bravado reminds of Seahawks #SB50, doesn't it?

That's just their persona, eh? Game is played on the field.
Chiefs are playing in the Super Bowl in ONE DAY. #ChiefsKingdom

This is going to be a good super bowl. Idk how the 49ers will guard the fully loaded healthy Chiefs receivers. But then again the 49ers defense is stupid nice and their run game is A1

@KatInTheCLE It should be Super Bowl Saturday. I’ll never understand why all the major championships are on Sunday or Monday nights.
Conservatives kept LGBT people out of jobs for decades. Now whenever one “makes it” they say “so what?” or “don’t shove it in my face.”

They created the condition in which an LGBT person coaching a Super Bowl team matters, and then ask why anyone’s mentioning it. 

Every. Time.

@PeterFinchGolf From a man in Kansas City, go with BBQ. Get some pulled pork or brisket with bbq beans. For typical Superbowl food, though, you can't go wrong with rotel dip and tortilla chips and wings and jalepeno poppers. Beer is also a must.
@DesignationSix No, I won't. And I literally cannot remember the last time I missed a Superbowl. Even in 1988, when I was in labor w my first daughter, I got them to turn on the game. (Redskins - Broncos, 40-something to 10)

How come every single “NFL expert” predicts a close super bowl? I want someone with the stones to predict the 49ers to win by 28 points. Don’t be a follower

@Dealer_Gaming Imagine how much worse the anxiety would get if Microsoft dropped an XBoxSeriesX ad during the SuperBowl. Unlikely to happen, but imagine the chaos and fustration of seeing one company moving forward with next gen while the other stays quiet.

I’m not going to lie, watching the Super Bowl is going to be different this year. I really got spoiled with watching my Pats for the last 3 years 😔 Nonetheless, it’s still giving a turn up for the 49ers.

@ThinkBlue47 @NFL Panthers vs Patriots is the best Superbowl that no one ever talks about.
I can’t wait for super bowl weekend to be over. Traffic has been terrible this week
I’m always interested in who the sports analysts, reporters, anchors pick to win the Super Bowl. It’s usually a good contrarian indicator. Out of the 100-plus predictions I read... more than 90% are picking the over. Bet the under.
Grandma just said she hopes the chiefs win the Super Bowl, I think this is where I cut ties

Horrendous journalistic decision by #FoxNews to have him do Trump intw during Super Bowl!!

1985 Super Bowl. Never forget this one. Marino had 5,000 yds. 48 TDs. 49ers had no chance. Media. Our D shut them down. 38-16. Same will happen to Chiefs/Mahomes. All we heard was how great Marino was. Now it’s Mahomes. I’ve seen how this ends. I feel this 2019 D is better.

And to know he will stand on that stage in Canton and represent the NFL experience that was in St. Louis is about as good as a Super Bowl weekend can go for a city that was so screwed over by the @NFL a few years ago. Can’t wait to hear the cheers of BRUUUUUCE in Canton.
To be rewarded with a Super Bowl during that 1999 season and a few special seasons that followed will always be how I remember the St. Louis Rams. Kurt Warner. Marshall Faulk. Isaac Bruce. Torry Holt. Orlando Pace. London Fletcher. Those are St. Louis Rams.
Interesting...I had no clue what @RocNation was doing for social justice behind the scenes. While I agree with @jemelehill that Jay Z didn't need a partnership with the NFL to do this work, I'm intrigued at the possibilities. https://t.co/qETI7wwWea #JayZ #SuperSaturdayNight

I’m ignoring the Super Bowl as always as I travelled to Schaumburg. I picked up a good haul of Blu-rays as usual. Then I saw “The Last Full Measure” before it left the theater there. It’s a solid film in the veins of “Courage Under Fire”, but falls into a TV movie trope at times.

@DJAC209 @maxkellerman Not saying I agree with the article, just found it interesting you could break it down to 3 plays. Bottom line Rams weren’t anything more than low end average this yr. Goff’s extension had no bearing but will starting now. This past yr on paper, was Rams chance to win Super Bowl

@brianportnoy Last 49ers Super Bowl I flew home and surprised my dad. Sad end to the game but very fun and worth it.
One of the best #Superbowl experiences for me is meeting all the great fans from all over.

Of all teams....here's my new buddy, #GoNiners fan Mauricio. https://t.co/pFm7wGd9od
@DaveDshauck I assume because most players have other plans the night before the Super Bowl that are too lucrative to cancel. So perhaps they air it live on NFL Net instead?

Here's my hot take for the #SuperBowl: We need to rename the team and it should be the Kansas City Sauce. Also, no one should probably play football anyway. I'm really fun at parties.
Had such fun having dinner with Peyton Manning talking about skiing. He finally took it up after retiring from the @NFL@SuperBowl. Such a class act. https://t.co/w5pgQATN51
Hope the Yankees win the Super Bowl
@EpiEllie @BestBuy @SuperBowl It speaks volumes, though. The store blamed corporate, saying they couldn't do a return without approval from them. Corporate said the stores have no reason not to accept a return within 15 days. Especially if exchange, and not refund.

You went to the gym 4x this week and ate pretty clean. Enjoy the time with family and focus on relationships not calories.
Prepping for the @indigomurphys Premier League and Super Bowl pregame day tomorrow. 
First batch of sausage rolls made, fixings for my signature Bloody Mary’s ready, &amp; lots more British snacks. All complimentary with the purchase of a beverage. Yours truly pulling pints all day https://t.co/z09m5luORf

Super Bowl Saturday is suppose to be a big party night. But all of my friends are lame so I’m at home watching Maine Cabin Masters on DIY Network.
Dad: You gonna watch the Super Bowl?
Me: HELL NO. I don’t care about the Chiefs.

@GilRaulito @TheActualCC It’s a Super Bowl past card. Calvin Johnson will probably be one of the first ULs. If they want to be clutch they would let us play with both the FS and WR Calvin. I don’t wanna give up that card

On the eve of it, it still astounds me that there hasn’t been more balking about giving network TV time during the Super Bowl pregame to a Hannity-Trump interview that is destined to be propaganda full of lies.

@NYforbernie2020 I want the Chiefs, only because I want Andy Reid to win a Superbowl.  I won't be angry if the 9ers win, I kinda like to pull for the underdogs. 🙂
@JBurnsE4 I agree bro. 100%. Sunday just gives more viewership. Nobody is gonna compete with the Super Bowl. On a Saturday night, those who would watch on Sunday may pass it up to do something else. So, it’s understandable but I wish it was a Saturday night event.

@ByJonHeath John Lynch "sucked" so much with #Broncos that he was elected to the #ProBowl in each of his four seasons in Denver - and was instrumental to a top D within one game of the #SuperBowl.

The only thing that could make me feel better is if the Super Bowl tomorrow is high scoring (for both teams). I don’t need another 13-3 game like last year

The #SuperBowl is tomorrow and I’m sooooo excited. Made my chili recipe for the party tomorrow. Had a bowl tonight for dinner and it’s a fucking masterpiece if I do say so myself. https://t.co/I0LNfNhkaF

Hey @BovadaOfficial I think something is wrong with your site. It won’t let me place a bet on @Dame_Lillard scoring 50+ tomorrow at the Super Bowl.
If I weren’t a @49ers fan, I’d more wholeheartedly agree. And that’s probably why if #goNiners lose, I’ll be sad, but not devastated. If I’m going to have to lose a Super a Bowl (please no), there’s not a more deserving fan base or coach. https://t.co/FYO7DAdI8I

Probably another reason I have no friends💡 https://t.co/ItkQr6mYWW

So my team plays for the Super Bowl today. Didn’t think I would ever type that. I’m bringing my dad’s Chiefs red coat. And I may just bring the SB4 mug of his too.
I still havent been invited to a Super Bowl function. Fuck it
The #SUPERBOWL is here again. Some of my friends want the #KCChiefs to win. But most of my friends don’t even know who’s playing.  They want to see #jlo and #shakira (yup, they’re gay). I want to see the commercials.  I’m in marketing. And I’m gay too. But who cares?

@MylesInSF I was born 2 years later but I'm listening to the @KNBR replay Super Bowl 29 right now heard Joe Starkey say on the air that the parade will be "tomorrow on Market Street"!
Wouldn't it be great if Mookie becomes a Dodger tomorrow the same day The Super Bowl is being played without the fucking Patriots in it. I think so. @Dodgers make it happen dammit!
Its officially SUPER BOWL SUNDAY. #ChiefsKingdom

age as the number of the 
Super Bowl.
De todos los deportes el que más detesto es el fútbol americano y pues mañana es el Super Bowl y adivinen quien estará manejando el evento.
Just knowing my family bout to eat good for the Super Bowl tomorrow &amp; im stuck at school 😭😂

Well one of my favorite days is here @SuperBowl &amp; that means a few things;of course the game, the #SuperBowl commercials, me anticipating winning some of my SB squares, reflecting on another @Lions horrible season &amp; NOT being in the SB, &amp; the end of football season #SuperBowlLIV
@KCrimiWFTV @KRayWFTV Good morning happy Groundhog Day Superbowl 54 Sunday. Or as I would like to call it, this Sunday that I would rather watch the movie Groundhog Day than hear the football pundits tell me who's going to win the Super Bowl for 6 hours before the game comes on.

Super Bowl Prediction:

Patrick Mahomes has the game of his life. Super Bowl MVP w/ 4+ TDs. I expect Hardman to shine. High scoring game w/ two excellent game plans. George Kittle will cause the Chiefs problems. Tyrann Mathieu will make a memorable play.

Chiefs 45, 49ers 41

@ESPNNFL @stephenasmith The only thing I'm gonna say about this is that Jimmy G. won't get credit even if he plays better than Patrick Mahomes.  Patrick Mahomes has already been crowned the best player in football.  He's already been crowned the best QB ever, and he's never one a Superbowl yet. 🥴
Happy Super Bowl Sunday All!!!  I have no loyalty to my home team and highly suggest they change there name to break the curse that has spread to the entire NFC East. If there’s a party that includes line dancing like the group I added in my post, please share your location. https://t.co/52TalPgR25

Super Bowl:
 
I placed these bets back a couple weeks ago due to being afraid of line movement. Still happy with them.

KC -1.5 (1u)
KC -1.5/ O5.25 (1u)

1u for football is about 3u for any other bet I place

Thinking about pulling a bait-and-switch on everyone who shows up for my Super Bowl party today and just playing Groundhog Day on a loop instead. Who doesn’t love Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell? Plus it’s not a legitimate NFL championship game without the Browns in it anyway.

My roommate legitimately just said that she is on the edge of her seat for #GroundhogDay2020. Who gives a f*ck about SuperBowl Sunday when it’s Groundhog Day? - @sydney_bak
Today’s date, 02-02-2020, an 8 digit palindrome which hasn’t been the case since medieval times, also happens to be Groundhog Day, and, yes, the Super Bowl. I’d be lying if I said I didn’t have a dog in this fight.… https://t.co/vYEuOwhzYQ
Yesterday:

Me: Hey are you going to a grocery store today?

Mom: No, whatcha need?

Me: I don’t need anything. I was just wanting some Mexican layer dip.

Mom: To bring somewhere tomorrow?

Me: What? Why tomorrow? It just sounds really good.

Finds out it’s #SuperBowl Sunday. 🤷🏻‍♂️ https://t.co/Qc6wxr9hK5
Yes, I celebrate the Super Bowl. Everyone gets together. Food &amp; Drinks, men on tights 🤤 oh and the Halftime show ✨🔥

Heavy @Chiefs today. @NewRo_FB own Jordan Lucas playing in the Super Bowl. New Ro’s got your back bro! https://t.co/tfcOeaSCBZ
Yay, sports! Do the thing! Get the points!

In all seriousness though; If you're watching the Super Bowl tonight, I hope you enjoy it. I have no interest in the game, so I see no point in my watching and snark posting about it. Let people like what they like.
Seriously, @espn talking to Antonio Brown on #SuperBowl Sunday. 

Get him off the damn TV. Talk about the teams in today’s game. Enough of him getting the spotlight.
Happy Super Bowl Day from beautiful Kansas City!(go see my stories to see how our town is lit up!)

Me: “honey, who are we playing today?”

My husband: 😳😫🙈

I think my favorite #SuperBowl memory was being at the GSR in Reno when Percy Harvin scored vs Denver ended any concerns of Seattle losing and guaranteeing I was cashing bets.  Seeing lifelong #Seahawks fans @TomDub11 @RossDub23 and @Dawg29 getting to celebrate was cool too.
What ima cook for the superbowl today???
It may be Super Bowl Sunday, but that’s not the only big-time game going down today.

They put him over the next regular season more than I predicted. But he did a job to his old team in the playoffs. Pushing the idea he truly was done.

All I want from the Superbowl is good defense and Pat Mahomes to amaze me. That is all.

my super bowl prediction: i’ll be asleep by the time the sonic movie spot comes up unfortunately and betts will be traded to the dodgers on tuesday

Trump running political ads during the Superbowl is definitively on brand.
this just in the WHOLE ASS BAR gave a standing ovation to the trump super bowl commercial. me and @RachaelHel are among the enemy pls pray.
Stevie from #SchittsCreek in a Super Bowl commercial so I’m content
@zolary_ @Drumr10k He’s talking about you not realizing it’s about the super bowl not fortnite
I played against Dre Greenlaw in High School. And now he’s in the Super Bowl. I guess you can say I helped mold him into the player he is today🤷🏼‍♂️
I just hope that whatever the outcome, the Chiefs and Forty-Niners players learn that the most important thing is the friends they make along the way. #SuperBowl

The idiot literally bought an ad spot to display his idiocy to attempt to cater to a stereotype during the superbowl. How many ppl just stopped watching?
@realDonaldTrump’s super bowl commercial claims credit for giving a second chance to nonviolent drug offenders.

In other words, for undoing the damage of the laws his own party refuses to take off the books.

Am I the only one that feels like political ads just ruined the whole fun of watching Super Bowl commercials this year? 🤮
Uggghhhhh can we not have political ads during the Super bowl 🙄🙄
The tradition will continue. Next break in this #SuperBowl I will boycott, for life, everything that is advertised. Currently 6:00 left in 1st quarter.

That Pro Trump add is the reason why every Super Bowl should end like the game in THE SUM OF ALL FEARS, and every year they play it with that exact same result until there are no teams/fans/cities left and then everyone celebrates the end of this idiotic sport/fandom.
@jamiekirkland Super Bowl champ!  Well done.  Congrats!!
@EmilyHampshire_ just seen your Super Bowl commercial!!!! I couldn’t explain to my bf fast enough who you were🤣❤️
Welp, that’s the only time Trump will ever be in a Super Bowl

The Trump Super Bowl ad is a reminder that he had the opportunity to forge a true partisan realignment and build a sustainable governing majority . Yet he left much of that potential unrealized.

The transition from the heartbreaking Google spot to the stupid Sabra ad with Ric Flair was unfortunate... and another reason to #BDS #SuperBowl
I can't believe I'm watching the #SuperBowl for the #Commercials and #HalftimeShow 😂 who'd wanna miss @shakira &amp; @JLo performing together? #SuperBowlLIV #SuperBowl2020 #football #PepsiHalftime @49ers @Chiefs #49ersvschiefs #49ers #Chiefs #ChiefsKingdom #49ersNation
Why isn’t @LilNasX performing at the super bowl? I want my money back

Can #11 on @Chiefs please wear different colored gloves for the 2nd half?? I keep thinking there's a flag on the play while watching #SuperBowl
I don't think they should show campaign commercials on the #Superbowl, because that isn't the time to get into politics, because it's a time to have fun &amp; showing those kinds of commercials during a tough time in politics would divide us.
Y’all be sure to let me know what Super Bowl commercials I should look up.

Did @verizon really just put out a #SuperBowl ad about supporting fire fighters?
Was that... a trailer for a trailer? #SuperBowl
@AceAtLarge @SuperBowl @TheAceTJShow My mom’s name is Loretta, my dad passed in 2018. I’m still crying. So touching.
That was the Pop Tarts commercial I didn’t know I needed. #LookingLikeASnack  #SuperBowl

They should have the Super Bowl broadcasted across multiple networks. 

So if I wanna hear Al Michaels &amp; Cris Collinsworth, or Joe Tessitore, Tony Romo, I mean I’d take Kirk Herbstreit over Troy Aikman.
Didn't @verizon  throttle a firefighter department data during an emergency?

Stupid Google. Super Bowl commercials aren’t supposed to make you cry. 😭 🏈 #SuperBowl #loretta
Too many people talking about the Super Bowl, not enough people talking about the Soup or Salad You Pick 2 Deal starting at $5.99 at your local Panera Bread!
Google far and away has the best commercial so far. Only Clydesdales and Golden Retrievers make me tear up like that.

Raheem Mostert runs into the end zone for another 49ers touchdown. Just like that, the interception by Mahomes pays 7 more points to San Francisco. After the PAT, the Niners are now ahead 20-10. #NFL100  #SuperBowl  #SBLIV  #SFvsKC

JLo is 50 and Shakira is 43 and here I am watching them while eating my body weight in chicken wings #SuperBowl
Taxpayers just paid another $3.4 million to send Trump to Florida this weekend so he could host a Super Bowl party for paying guests at his for-profit golf course. When is America going to learn this is not a monarchy? #TrumpIsCorrupt #TrumpSuperbowl2020

KC needs a big spark on this drive, they have been flat since 1/2 way through the second quarter #SuperBowl

Only thing I enjoy the Super Bowl this year is to listen to my favorite broadcaster, Greg Papa for the Niners. I’m NOT a Niners fan though. He was a Raiders broadcaster, so I used to listen to him a lot.

Game has been good. Commercials suck. @tide has made me chuckle and @google was great. Halftime was amazing. Loved it. Let’s see what the second half holds. #SuperBowl
@_cesarnava_ For other games, I would say no. I was at the Pats-Ravens games and saw a lot of people wearing jerseys of other teams. I thought that was weird. But maybe the Super Bowl is more of a celebration of the sport. For us, it’s one more chance to wear our stuff until next season
TOUCHDOWN!!!!! #49ers #SuperBowl
The little cartoon graphics of the football players in the #SuperBowl are not pleasant
It’s the Super Bowl Sunday and I am hoping it’s going to be a good game. Typically, I throw a big Super Bowl party every year, but January was exhausting on many, many, many levels and I just wasn’t up for it. That… https://t.co/t7JDtY7cgq
I’m sorry but that #PepsiHalftime show with @JLo and @shakira was 🔥🔥🔥

I am so happy that the Super Bowl half time was full of Latinos. We watched the half time show at the whitest house in town. It was priceless to see the faces of many individuals who get uncomfortable while listening to other languages (not the hosts). #SuperBowl #LatinoGang https://t.co/58rMqr4Hu0

The Super Bowl is a national holiday if you don’t celebrate you are a communist
NFL: Super Bowl ends at 10:00 pm on a Sunday. “We really should make Monday a national holiday.”

MLB: World Series games run from 8:08 until after midnight on a Wednesday. “For some reason, we’re having trouble growing the game among young people.”

Well, 49ers are down now, so bring baseball back. #SuperBowl 😤🥺🤬
I would be ok if the #Lions had to play the #Chiefs in the super bowl next year.
regardless of who wins, can I just say, this is the way the superbowl is supposed to be played. well done
Things I’ve learned from Super Bowl commercials:
1. 5G works everywhere, even the club 
2. Electric cars are just normal cars now
3. Charlie Day doesn’t know how to use a fucking washing machine
Man it is so sweet when a Super Bowl delivers an incredible game
Finally a good super bowl.....what a game.   #SuperBowLIV
When is it appropriate to stop hyping up super bowl ads? They used to be clever, funny viral moments. 

Now, they are just commercials.
Was that finally @deesnider's Super Bowl moment?
When is it allowed to hit after the play and the whistle.  I thought that was unnecessary roughness. #SuperBowl

How many EV commercials you see tonight during the Super Bowl? 4-5? Notice how not one of them was for Tesla? What does that tell you? The electric revolution has begun baby!
The amount of cross marketing in this superbowl is ridiculous. Are prices so high companies have to go in together for affordability reasons?

Barely watched the Super Bowl 🙄😭
When they asked Mahomes what he was gonna do now that he won the Super Bowl, I was hoping he would’ve said “I’m gonna have a little bit of the bubbly” oh well. @IAmJericho  he might need the hookup from #lechampion #SuperBowl #littlebitofthebubbly #GoChiefs
The shuttle service of the #NFL at #SBLIV for the credentialed media is the worst I experienced in almost 25 years of #SuperBowl Would be better i.e. existing in any given Third World spot. Shame on you guys!

@ZackFlipse @eric_nehm Not that I know of, but the replay room has access to the timing of every shot. He could have multiple shots lined up for the director to take. It’s not terribly complicated especially for a broadcast like the Super Bowl.
Andy Reid is bad at clock management. 

Andy Reid is good, just not good enough. 

Andy Reid will NEVER win the big one. 

Andy Reid is the coach of the Super Bowl Champion Kansas City Chiefs.

The KC Chiefs won Super Bowl 54. A team owned by people who don’t care about being out front. And they empower their coach. Jerry Jones going on year 25 of showing the NFL world you don’t have to empower coaches to win Superbowls.
Super bowl 54 was too much for the 49ers but anyone who could do math knew that.

I tear up every time I watch Prince perform Purple Rain at the Super Bowl.
Our Super Bowl party was a success thanks to screaming Latina love for the halftime show (all Colombians don’t move like Shakira, I am told), tons of food, and excellent company. We even snuck in a little time for some fun, informal mentoring! @MCWGreenBay #ACOGMentorship https://t.co/jKDsTr1ja9
One of the BEST Super Bowl performances I’ve seen 🔥🇵🇷
It feels nuts to have witnessed a World Series and Superbowl win in a span of 5 years. I may live in NYC, but the heart stays reppin Kansas City #chiefs #kansascity #royals

There wasn’t a SINGLE holding penalty called on an offensive player in the Super Bowl....@colecubelic interested in your thoughts. Greatest refs ever? Greatest technique ever? Let em play?!? Seems insane to not have ONE?!?

Don’t care that tonight was the super bowl..... big news was Brady commercial. Still don’t think he’s staying though 🤷🏻‍♂️
@SpyGateDown To be super honest I was at a Super Bowl party I wasn’t sure what day it was in either sell whatever who the fuck cares the bottom line they won and beat the 49ers Nancy Pelosi’s District and I’ll give a shit
What a Super Bowl and congrats to @PatrickMahomes and #ChiefsKingdom!
@PatrickMahomes So proud of you. First second string to win Super Bowl. You were awesome 👏

It's OK to work really hard. It's OK to be successful. It's OK to make billions. It's OK to start an ill-fated presidential run and blow millions on a super bowl ad. Its OK to shake a dogs snout like its a human hand.

Do what you need to do to cope.
Kyle Shanahan may be the greatest coach for 3 quarters in Super Bowl history, he just need to hire someone to help him through the 4th Quarter.

@realDonaldTrump We paid as tax’s payers 3.4 million dollars for your Super Bowl !!!
Garoppolo deserves far more blame for the debacle. His performance was very reminiscent of Goff’s Super Bowl letdown. The difference is Goff has actually delivered in big games (Vikings, Chiefs, Saints). Can’t say the same for Garoppolo. Huge question mark going forward.

This makes sense. Niners favored for return despite the “super bowl hangover” notion. Every key player on the Niners is returning + a full healthy offseason for Jimmy + a year of experience added for the youth. But still you never know with football! https://t.co/fKXgtP7B3s

@tacobell I’m not super concerned with any refund or anything like that, the chiefs just won the super bowl so I’m feeling great. However, if someone who was not myself encountered this issue I can say they would handle it with as much grace as me.

@ronjenkins23 Dude, I’ve been a Pats fan since Tom’s first Super Bowl when I was 5 against the Rams in 02. Multiple tweets and people can confirm that. Tried to make a really nice post congratulating (true) Chiefs fans. If there was ever a time for me to be a bandwagon fan it’d be right now.

@MoveTheSticks 1) bullshit. Did you see how poorly he coached the Eagles in the Super Bowl a bunch of years ago? Worst clock management possible. He's since gotten a bit better.

I thoroughly enjoyed the Super Bowl halftime show but enough with the Shakira tongue GIF. Save your jokes. Somehow Twitter has already killed it in record time.

Real talk, 9ers had a legendary season. Kyle Shanahan isn't even in his final form and will no doubt improve as a coach, as will the team as a whole. This won't be the last we see them in the Superbowl. A franchise to be reckoned with for years to come.
The one-two punch of watching The Good Place finale + the Super Bowl halftime show is healing me.

@PalmerReport While Trump’s 1st 30-second ad ran in the first quarter, his second 30-sec ad did not air until minutes after the game ended before the Lombardi trophy was presented. Official Super Bowl spots are defined as advertisements that run btwn kickoff &amp; when the clock runs out. - Adweek

@MFHootsWRCB @JustinWRCB @Perry_Ely Sure. I’ll take the good looks and TWO Super Bowl rings like Jimmy has. #OVCProud
@norcalpunkman True but I honestly think this Super Bowl loss will somehow start a dynasty! Jalen Hurd gonna be back 100% healthy next year and John Lynch is gonna make some key moves. Think of it like the Warriors NBA Finals loss in 2016.... This one still hurts though :(
Honestly, didn't want @Chiefs to win... but I am glad that @PatrickMahomes got a ring!!! Congrats!!! #SuperBowl #SuperBowl2020 #KansasCityChiefs

@Akemm2Annette @gingerbanks1 @Franklin_Graham @pepsi You're wrong in assuming things about my kids or my faith.

That halftime show was completely apropos for a Super Bowl in Miami.  If it wasn't your cup o' tea, the remote is right there.  No one's shoving anything in your face.

The #HalftimeShow wasn’t horrible🤷🏽‍♀️more like eating a PopChip in place of crunchy Salt &amp; Vinegar Lay’s... PopChips will do but it just not as satisfying or memorable. Loved all of the POCs tho. #SuperBowl  My Chiefs rocked! #ChiefsKindgom

In related news, President Trump paid millions for a Super Bowl ad, but negated its effects by congratulating the wrong state. A less-than-zero-sum game.

Working the day after the super bowl should be a crime
I’m definitely not on the whole “jimmy played a bad quarter so now he stinks”.. every time the 49ers needed Jimmy to carry the team this season he did. Big throws.. big drives.. he did it. Playoffs wasn’t as needed until 4th qtr in the SuperBowl and he came up short. Thats tough

@hellorenee Okay I txt’d my mom being like “wow I’m so proud of the 49ers, they did that.” But they did. They gave us the first truly fun super bowl in years. 👀
And with me using the word “dynasty” when referring to the Chiefs, I’m done writing. I can’t believe I wrote that &amp; meant it.

As long as Patrick Mahomes is the Chiefs QB, the road to the Super Bowl will continue to go through him.

Congrats to Andy Reid! SUPER BOWL CHAMPS!
Let me tell you...I’m a loyal man but those are two very beautiful women. And they showed it off. I’ll leave it there. 😂

- Lastly, I fully expect the Chiefs to win the AFC again next season. They have some contracts to take care of. It’s amazing that a Super Bowl...
I did not expect a mediocre game from Kelce. Two Mahomes INTs made sense to me. But I’ll live with the outcome that’s for sure 🤣 the Chiefs won a Super Bowl in a game in which I didn’t feel like they played all that well.

- Anyone holding onto Williams possibly not...
Just realized the @Chiefs scored 21 UNANSWERED points in the SUPER BOWL with less than 7 min left in the game. Give Andy and Patrick credit HOLY CRAP https://t.co/MQBBkUJSa9
...unsuccessful in what probably felt like him as the game of his life. He had his chance against a cross-conference former team &amp; fell short. I wasn’t a huge fan of players carrying on the narrative of being “one play short” last season from a Super Bowl appearance.
@FOX10Phoenix I don’t think @JLo vegas show was appropriate for the Super Bowl...more appropriate for an adult only audience, but that’s on her &amp; those who booked the event. Nonetheless, both @shakira and @JLo look amazing &amp; dance beautifully; loved the last part...incredible footwork! 👣

The Chiefs have been Super Bowl Champs for like 4 hours and it still sounds absolutely insane. Might as well win like 10 in a row now I guess.
Real talk: 

I didn’t know today was the #SuperBowl until I went on twitter &amp; saw posts on SUPERB OWLS.

FOX produced a great game. It felt like the first chapter in the next saga. Mahomes. 4K. Good halftime shows. If that’s the future, the #NFL will be just alright. #SuperBowl
@veronika_quispe Then what was it supposed to represent? Having 2 latinas perform in Miami sends a pretty strong message. If the super bowl was in North Carolina, I doubt Shakira and JLo would be the headliners.
Cardi B really said no to the Super Bowl and they performed her song anyway.
Congratulations  to the Kansas City Chiefs on winning Super Bowl LIV!!!

Meanwhile the super bowl halftime show was bleh, for some reason they Felt the need to switch to pole dancing this year, yikes.
I didn’t really watch it, i just watched clips of it on YouTube.
in the part of missouri where I grew up, we basically considered KC to be Kansas (culturally) plus like over half the metro area is on the kansas side so like what did they win the super bowl or something

@JLo queen tonight at the super bowl had time
#Superbowl Well &amp; Truly Ticked Off The Bucket list ✔️ what a way to end an unbelievable week.

Thank u @nfl_uk , Gutted the season is over man 🥺 But that being said,

GO CHIEFS 💪🏾🏈 #Champs #chiefskingdom… https://t.co/fQgZ3sHtQ4

Super Bowl Champs!!! It’s surreal to say it but unbelievable that it happened. Never been so happy and never doubted this team. From training camp to now this is my damn team💯 #SuperBowlLIV
https://t.co/6T58Vamby3
@MercPurdy But from a fan perspective, I think the focus on the game itself is a misnomer. There's a fun way around that - I've been to 14 of the last 19 #SuperBowl weeks and only one game.
https://t.co/4pr54gNM3h
🙌🏼 So proud of the Chiefs for winning this super bowl!! Patrick Mahomes is a great QB &amp; I think he definitely deserved this win 🙌🏼 https://t.co/ggxZ3nyuKR
Speaking things into existence. I can’t wait to host Super Bowl watch parties at my beautiful home with my fine ass husband
I know my 49ers didnt win the Superbowl, but they kind of did win anyway ❤ https://t.co/S45jP9HThI
@JackPosobiec The only positive aspect of this year's Super Bowl.
@dieter Actually I found a #SuperBowl Plan B that's worked quite well for the last couple of decades. Incredible football midwinter vacation and experiences sans the game.

Dla tych którzy przespali Halftime Show, klasa światowa. Shakira i JLo dały czadu, za serce łapały przepięknie śpiewające dzieci, był tez krzyż i flaga Puerto Rico (rodzice JLo pochodzą stamtąd) https://t.co/Cd62eMzN7e #SuperBowl #NFLpl
tl;dr Superbowl recap https://t.co/ZEVXVRnvtJ
Ngl if Pat Mahomes plays good in the Super Bowl, they win by atleast 21.
@elb714 It's ok, my team didn't go super bowl. So one day I'll drink my life always wit ya too😂😂😂hope u like water lol
@MicheleQuirke The Demons aren't football fans. They're more for racing (NASCAR).  In fact, Seth dreams of driving in NASCAR someday. However, they do love throwing parties and would probably enjoy the Super Bowl just for that.
LMAO who has their mom hit up their ex to harass them over a super bowl win... you real life obsessed &amp; pathetic 🥴 it's been 2 years and my friend is in a happy relationship, why are you still thinking about her?? And then says "TRUMP is your president sucks to be YOU!!!" 😂😂

@SkolMemes The Vikings are ONE coordinator that gives a shit away from a championship. One coordinator that wants to win a championship over a bigger paycheck. Or is it that the front office just wants to stay relevant to sell tickets instead of winning a Super Bowl? We’ll never know. 😔
@benmaller The emotional PEAK of the Super Bowl.......The Halftime Show! Did you see all the ass shaking going on out there, thought maybe an earthquake hit Miami. And the end of the performance was rumpalicious. Hello

Dear @realDonaldTrump black voters really don't like you. No lying Super Bowl ad claim can change the way we feel about you being a racist, uninformed ignoramus that's not fit to lead our great country. Your ad is as ridiculous as saying you're having fun being impeached.

I was so high after the Super Bowl went off. I don’t remember driving home.
Yo no vi el final del SuperBowl, y claro, en el TL, nadie ha dicho quién ganó — lo que se ve son las mismas fotos del cuero de JLo (CON LA BANDERA) y BadBunny.

@bobconfer One year I got the flu and called in the day after a Super Bowl and the person said “yeaahh sure. Partied too hard huh?” They didn’t believe that not only do I not “party”, I don’t watch the Super Bowl. It was a terrible feeling.

The Democratic Party should've bought a Super Bowl commercial where they introduced their lineup of candidates for president, Senate, Congress and governorships, in the style of a football all-star roster. I'm surprised that neither party has done that yet... #SDHsez #DNC

You do not “skip the super bowl” the SuperBowl skips you.
@realDonaldTrump From a”stable genius” President who doesn’t know that Kansas City is in MO;he tweeted congratulations to the Kansas City Chiefs on winning the Super Bowl &amp; said they represented the”great state of Kansas”! Then he deleted it (maybe some kindergartener told him that it’s in MO)!
After much considered thought, I think this is probably the worst commercial of last night.

Strange concept with what’s now a dated song, and I can’t figure out what the message is supposed to be... 🤷🏻‍♂️

@TomKaminskiWCBS Julia and I cried and held each other. And then I cursed out Google for making me cry during the Super Bowl (something I never thought I’d do unless the Jets won it all)
I've never felt this old before but I truly understand why so many call off the day after the Superbowl... 

#SuperBowl
So the #patriots didn’t win the #SuperBowl last night? Asking for a friend...

FoxNews knows those red-blooded, and, yes, white Americans are loyal. And so does Trump. My conservative podcast partner texted me as soon as he saw Trump’s Super Bowl ad — telling me he can’t lose in 2020. 😐 The ad is brilliant; the media lies about Don’s racism, dontcha know.

I watched the Super Bowl on mute. I don’t know what the announcers said, or what the general feeling is, but it sure seemed like the Chiefs got some significant breaks/calls/no-calls in that game. I don’t really care, just what I saw. 

It’s baseball season, nothing else matters.
I’m in a blue state &amp; at a Super Bowl party on the strip &amp; when that trump commercial came on, they stood up &amp; cheered &amp; yelled shit like “that’s right”...they were mostly white of course, but if the dems don’t figure it out, it’ll be a landslide in Nov. they are brainwashed.

The Superbowl is an American family event like July 4 barbecue or Thanksgiving or Christmas Dinner. That halftime show was for an adult "gentlemans" strip club or casino.

Andy Reid won his first Super Bowl championship, his 222nd career game — including both regular season and postseason — on February 2nd, 2020... 2/2/20. 2+2+2=6; Reid also currently sits 6th on the NFL’s all-time list for wins by a head coach.

It bothers me that so many people felt the Super Bowl halftime was not kid friendly. 

Why are you worried about kid friendly? 

That’s two proud women - sharing their talent and appreciating their culture. 

In this day and age we need more of that.
@stephenasmith Glad to see the Chief's win.  Thank God the Dallas Cryboys weren't in the Super Bowl.

President Trump congratulated the 'Great State of Kansas' after the Chiefs' Super Bowl win. They play in Kansas City, Missouri.

From Sports Illustrated
Next president that promises me the Monday after the Super Bowl is a national holiday has my vote no matter what. On god.
Good morning, Kansas City. You’re home to the Super Bowl Champion #Chiefs.
I didn’t watch the super bowl 🤷🏽‍♀️.... was it good?
Not over that halftime show! The Super Bowl is not my favorite. I think it conflates a lot of what the NFL stands for with America. The halftime was THE opposite of that! It was fun, and female, and purposeful. (And had literally all the hits from my dancing years.)
All of us during the #superbowl halftime show. 😜😜😜😜😜 https://t.co/2OlktgrQZY
If the Kansas City Chiefs post-season run didn’t prove that you can come back in the face of adversity, being down double digits in all three of their wins leading to their first super bowl win in 50 years, I don’t know what does. Never stop and play your game; trust the process.
Congrats to Big Red, @Chiefs and especially the pride of Wissahickon High School, Tanoh @Passinyo !!! Super Bowl Champions 🏆 Bring the Lombardi Trophy to Ambler, PA!!! #ChiefsKingdom ❤️🏈 #WissPride 💛💙🏈 #SuperBowlLIV

It's being floated to have both Superbowl teams visit the White House so Nick Bosa gets some screen time with the sitting president.
Everyone slammed the Over 117 seconds for national anthem, Heads, and 49ers Moneyline. I picked the Chiefs, the under for the national anthem, &amp; tails. I also bet on the over/under for every quarter. I went 7-0 in Super Bowl bets last night including a comeback win. What a night.
Jammed out to “Jenny from the Block” this morning.. thank you @SuperBowl 😂👏🏼😝
@Patsnation87 True that.  I knew we would have an epic Super Bowl.  Maybe not a Top Five but a compelling game nonetheless.  

And we move forward.
This is the kind of reassurance the public needs at a time like this

@bobbybonesshow @Chiefs Didn't like the 49ers growing up because they were a big rival with my Cowboys so I went with the Chiefs because they hadn't won a Super Bowl. so glad I did. the ending of this Super Bowl was fantastic. oh I also won the 2nd &amp; 3rd quarters on our squares.
But Shakira!!!! Them hips were everywhere!! She stole the show with them hips 😉

I would like to start by saying. Patrick Mahomes is the best QB present time. He never really found the phone booth last night, though.I think he won a popularity contest when it comes to the SB MVP.

The Super Bowl was a good, hard fought game. Really a couple defined plays helped KC comeback and win. 
Kittles OPI at the end of first half, KCs 3rd and long completion &amp; really 49ers shying away from their offensive  game plan in the 4th. 
49ers let an elite QB stay in the game
Briefly yesterday “JLo/Shakira” were trending at the same time as “Victoria Secret objectifies women.” 

It’s the small things in life that entertain me.

Being subject to Joy Behar 24/7 is considered cruel and unusual punishment under the Constitution.
I'm just going to say this. I'm happy for the Chiefs and Andy Reid for winning the Superbowl.  I don't think Patrick Mahomes lived up to all the hype.  He only made like 2 great plays.  I'm relieved, because I think my QB could have done better.
CONGRATULATIONS to the Super Bowl Champions Kansas City CHIEFS!

@GovMikeHuckabee @SarahHuckabee @SuperBowl Grandkids are the best.
Seeing a lot of "When Janet busted out a tiddy" here on Twitter dot com today. 

Reminder that Justin Timberlake *ripped off part of her costume,* exposing her. She didn't do anything. 

Why are we still putting it on her, 16 years later???

And the Chiefs came back and won the whole thing!! Congratulations 🍾🎊🎉 to the entire team &amp; their fans. @cookiepam1 @kcchiefs @ Superbowl Weekend https://t.co/0LIDSsSSWD
I think what we all learned today from the Super Bowl is that Latinas are superior :)
WHAT AN AMAZING/ AWESOME / INCREDIBLE SUPERBOWL SUNDAY!! The 14th annual Super Bowl Party was a a blast, so much fun! I cannot thank everyone enough for making it possible! #SuperBowl… https://t.co/vracGVUMfy
@PatrickMahomes congratulations of the SuperBowl win and your MVP.
The worst part about the super bowl https://t.co/nHzRvDezmW https://t.co/T614JevAOm
Looks like the search for effective post-game ride share logistics will continue. Super Bowl officials were reasonably optimistic about their plan, even if they expected heavy volume. https://t.co/Ne1keulLgT
@sayandskotann @aimeetoons @jessicayflores @PettyWakandan @Hidden_Clover @jemelehill Janet was crucified because of Les Moonves, the president of the network that aired ther Superbowl at the time. He purposefully and methodically ruined her career.

Super Bowl Monday is the perfect time for a HIIT. Loved this one with a mix of treadmill and core strength. 

Four days in a row, time for some rest days @moneyrunning1

Looking forward to the team of destiny, the Detroit Lions to win the Super Bowl this year.

@livecnn Super Bowl Halftime was shameful.... the worst ever... #sexualexplotation
All I can say is that it is a good thing @BadgerWyo doesn’t live any closer or I wouldn’t get anything done other than playing 18XX games 5 full games and another half of one that was interrupted by the Super Bowl in parts of 3 days, plus I was introduced to the @GameMadison guys https://t.co/V3VPvHYhTa
@JoyYWu My vote also goes to embarrassment about Super Bowl weekend conference organization #whodoesthat
I’ve heard so much about the google super bowl ad, both in person.

One piece of critical feedback I’ve seen on the internets “that’s a lot of money for a brand spot”

Well, you just proved it worked.  The social conversations are worth it.
Good #Monday morning friends! Hopefully your #SuperBowl fatigue is doing better than you expected! It’s going to feel like #spring today. Check out the blog. Updates all day long on @WAVY_News 10! https://t.co/IShFIQwQic
Still listening to @shakira this morning because why not? #SuperBowl
A rather large reason why I did not watch the Super Bowl this year was because of these two. 

They are just awful at commenting on sports. https://t.co/VfdYbFMAFA
@tye_diggs The best fighters from all 32 teams have an over the top rope challenge and the last person standing guarantees their team a super bowl sport.

What’s worse?  Pre-game analysis of the Super Bowl or pre-caucus day analysis of Iowa?
Congrats To Head Coach Andy Reid On His First Ever Super Bowl Win As The Head Coach.
I just watched the Super Bowl halftime show because I’m a boomer and fell asleep before it started last night and anyone hating on it is crazy. These women are PHENOMENAL.
@AdamHBeasley Damien Williams should have at leat been co MVP of the Superbowl. Happy for all those guys  that got of Miami for better tram and organization. Congratulations!.

@TheRealDaytime So proud!! I cried it was amazing best halftime show in awhile, they murdered that stage they represented our people last night with pride. In my opinion Latinos won the superbowl last night ❤❤ #LATINOGANG
Woke up and the chiefs are still Super Bowl champions. I can now confirm last night was not a dream.
Let me get this straight... @clairecmc was in Miami last night to witness the @Chiefs win the #SuperBowl and then was in Iowa this morning with @SavannahGuthrie and @PeterAlexander on @TODAYshow!? While I was changing sleeping positions, she was changing time zones. Impressive! https://t.co/E2CapBrCxE
I was happy last night, but my parents have been @Chiefs fans since before I was born. My mom texted me that she cried after the #SuperBowl. I'm beyond happy for them. #ChiefsKingdom
Que felicidad tengo de que en el Super Bowl lo que hubo fue Latino Gang 😎🔥
@PatrickMahomes aint no damn super bowl mvp
@danbickley @Bickley_Marotta @Vincemarotta Thank god we have Kyler! Already the 2nd best QB in the division, and has the skill set and upside to compete with Mahoney and Jackson…and win a Super Bowl for AZ! Petty clear Garrapolo has limited upside in today’s NFL.

The refs did not cost the 49ers the Super Bowl.  That trope is so tired.

The end of the first half sequence where you are in a tie game and you have a chance to score...but you instead sit on your timeouts...was just as costly.
What a half time...

@640wxsm FTR, I didn't watch the Super Bowl. I really don't watch the NFL anymore and I still can't believe you hadn't heard of TB12.  @WJHL_Kenny I might watch the first game in Vegas, because the stadium looks like a giant Roomba and I want to know what it looks like inside.
@DownDistanceFBL @MattVerderame A QB who in just two seasons has an MVP and a Super Bowl Champion to his name. As a chiefs fan, who’s waited so long and lived through so much heartbreak, it’s crazy to think about but the Chiefs are built for not just this year but many more to come

The Super Bowl is an amazing creation. I mean, any place that could keep more than three Latin women together without an incident is doing something right.

@realDonaldTrump i know a lot of American citizens who couldn't afford the luxury of chicken wings to watch the super bowl and this impeached old guy spends 3.5 million dollars of those same American citizens money on a sleazy party of his own. RIP Republican party

Ticky tack OPI but no holding calls all night. The 49ers dline was MUGGED.

Specifically, the 3rd and 15 play to Hill, Bosa was held so badly. No call.

@jackbell25 It’s something to be proud of? Like I said? 2 Super Bowl appearances in the last decade is good. Being 3-0 in playoffs against the packers is good. Is that good enough for you? I know I can’t please everyone
Congrats to KC...Disappointed but I can’t stay mad. This weekend in Miami was beyond incredible! We won 4 games last year so this year’s Super Bowl run really felt like a dream. Surreal. I love this team. They remind why I love sports so much! Until next season...#GoNiners

The low point of last night was when everyone watching the Super Bowl at my house made fun of me for reading football recaps in the New York Times.  That and when I accidentally blended the dip I was making onto my kitchen ceiling.
Really proud of myself for being at work the day after the superbowl...an hr late but im here!!

- Maybe I should start a plant-based diet.
- White people are gonna be mad about the Puerto Rican flag.
- Shakira’s a lot shorter than JLo.

@erjmanlasvegas I like it. But,  if the MSM got a hold of that,  the headlines would read:
Incredulous Boomer Rube Lineup for Super Bowl Halftime Show!
So why are some people being salty about the Super Bowl halftime show? It’s the Puerto Rican flag not the Cuban flag and the songs were not all in Spanish. Honestly, who cares This is Miami
This is the commercial that had me crying at a super bowl party. https://t.co/giIuefXNPT

If you’re uppity about the Super Bowl halftime show and don’t even know why Tyreek Hill winning a ring is problematic....then you don’t have moral high ground, You’re just practicing misogyny.

Me: no the Planters one.
To add yet another complicated layer to the convo on Super Bowl halftime show, if Bad Bunny had performed “Vete” I would have been in rare form.

@katebuckley1 Totally agree- I guess the saving grace for the spend is that they are now releasing ads beforehand to get some additional exposure and it is talked about, ranked, and shared post Super Bowl as well.  But- those dollars would go a long way digitally!

Last night I joked that the Super Bowl halftime show just got Trump re-elected. Reading stuff about it from angry, white, conservative, racist, sexist, folks (or as they’re called, Trump supporters), I think I might actually be right.
@Soy_SAF https://t.co/4Xf39x997p
Statistics show that 50% of males between the ages of 18-28 missed the entire second half of the Super Bowl last night. 40% took their lady to the rack, 40% went to a strip club, and the nerds (20%) were wacking  off in Mom’s bathroom. Great halftime show.
@barnett_pim @CheriJacobus Hire Bloomberg. He knows all of trumps buttons and is not likely to get rattled by the banal personal insults. Pretty good executive, I’d say. Super Bowl ads say everything about these two.

@Phantessma @flybyjerry It's that their performance has moved into the mainstream level and something that people alternatively consider inspiring, confidence building, or salacious was picked for the super bowl, which tells me it might actually just be boring and normal instead.

I didn't think it was too much, but considering I view the super bowl halftime as something that's meant to be wide appeal and very safe it's an interesting choice from *that* angle.

The Pepsi Latina Super Bowl show was certainly not wholesome family entertainment.There was enough booty shaking, twirking, bumping, grinding &amp; poll dancing for a lifetime. Disgusting &amp; very demeaning show, especially for Latinas &amp; women of all nationalities&amp;races.
Tell this to @PatrickMahomes 

Not everything that is faced can be changed, but nothing can be changed until it is faced.

He faced the 49er's and won a Superbowl. #ChiefsKingdom #NFL

To everyone mad about the Super Bowl half time show , whoever y’all thought was better apparently wasn’t because of not they woulda performed 🤭 Reggaeton is the most popular genre right now so why would they not be smart enough to get more views for more money. It’s business 🤷🏽‍♀️
I feel like the day after the Super Bowl should be a national day off 🤷🏼‍♂️ I mean seriously the Super Bowl is more of a holiday than President’s day is and we get that day off

Can the kid who started petition to move @SuperBowl to Saturday also start one to ban confetti cannon celebrations? It’s the #SuperBowl not a third grade birthday party. Don’t need confetti to hype and distract. @NFL @nflcommish #Marketing
Damn the next Super Bowl gonna be in tampa
@mschlapp Cool. Now do, the Puerto Rico flag is really from Cuba. Then you will have covered for the full panoply of winger ignorance on Super Bowl Sunday. 👍

Skip Brainless really said Brady should have been Super Bowl MVP last year, and his QBR was like 60. Mahomes was 62 yesterday and that was Skip’s main argument as to why he shouldn’t have been 😂😂😂 old man has dementia @RealSkipBayless

there was supposed to be a medical marijuana commercial during the super bowl but CBS banned it from playing. at the same time they’re shoving alcohol commercials down our throat.
Last night’s Super Bowl commercials were not great. Why? They’re anchored by these ads, add in the NFL’s further theft of Colin Kaepernick’s message...yuck https://t.co/BBslW8l91y
“Using the same logic employed by Irving, one could say just 3% to 5% of rape accusations are true, since that’s how many go to trial and result in a guilty finding.”

Today instead of addressing everyone as "Hey man" or "Thanks captain" or "See ya, dude", it will be "Hi chief" &amp; "Take care, chief" &amp;  possibly "Nice win in the Iowa caucus, there chief/chieftess!"

If you are a non-black latinx, don't gaslight black latinx who have critiques on the Super bowl half time show. All those genres showcased last night originated with them. Reggaeton, salsa, cumbia etc. would not exist without them. So celebrate and uplift them.

WHERE DOES YESTERDAYS SUPER BOWL RANK? I NEED A LIST. Somewhere around top 20. With better first half clock management, probably top 10.
@davidfholt .The effort was extraordinary! I agree, Kudos to #Miami. In spite of rare cool weather (colder than #OKC), every event was perfect. We are here and saw it first hand! #MiamiBeach #SuperBowl https://t.co/0iWIln2Xub

I'm glad Andy got a super bowl win but I could care less about any other team than the Eagles and we gonna be playing in that game next year ✊
Working after a Super Bowl, should be illegal
Honestly dude I don’t care how “well” she played them, I was hype af when I saw Shakira play not just guitar, but she also hopped on the drums during the Super Bowl. I hope that performance will inspire millions of people to pick up an instrument and rock out.
It would be ridiculous  to get off Super Bowl Monday but have to work on Easter. Around 37% of Americans are football fans while around 65% are Christian. A day to be hungover is not holiday worthy to me 🤷🏾‍♂️ https://t.co/Izvjjl9oo0
@JJ_dds My coworker and I were talking about past halftime shows and another great 1 in my opinion was U2.  The Superbowl after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.  That was awesome too!
I hope the @NFL consider @daddy_yankee for a haltf time in a super bowl. It would be good. #SuperBowl #SuperBowlHalftimeShow
@kvngjers We had a 10 point lead going into the 4th. He had no problem not passing the ball two weeks ago. Should have stuck with it last night. This makes me sicker than the Kaepernick Super Bowl.
Andy Reid won a Super Bowl then went home and had the sex and hasn’t stopped bragging about it and that’s just never a tweet I expected to tweet
I don’t care about the Super Bowl at all but Zootopia is 🔥.

@sdutPosner He is a young enough HC to learn from his mistakes if they get back there but that is the tough part getting back to the Super Bowl.
That’s cool for him, I spent it watching two teams I hated since birth play in the Super Bowl, eventho I stopped hating the niners in week 17, it still felt wrong. My day was worse &amp; more important. https://t.co/9UkcPptH5m
Yes. The super bowl was hell for my neighbors and every dog on the block because of the endless fireworks.
@JLo @HardRockStadium You did yo dam thing at the Superbowl,Beautiful lady And Actress..I wanna be like u when i grow up
Thank you @livedesignmag, for being the sunshine in today’s winter storm ❄️

https://t.co/laGPCBzXmh
@GolicAndWingo @danorlovsky7 Time to block Dan like I did to Nick Wright months ago.... did you watch the Super Bowl?! “Best performance that we’ve seen in the NFL”, doesn’t get carried by your RB, who shoulda been MVP, and/or throw 2 INT and a fumble. GTFOH! Great performance in last 6 min is more like it!
Idk who won the super bowl, but I said it once and I’ll say it again, last night was a movie https://t.co/ivhyTXxuNf
I didn’t post clips of the Super Bowl halftime show from my tv on my Instagram story... you’re welcome.
Next Super Bowl odds are open
NFCN:
Packers 18-1
Vikes 25-1
Bears 30-1
Lions 100-1 https://t.co/jerhGGLcBR
I didn’t know the super bowl was yesterday 🤷🏾‍♂️
Damn I feel bad for @AROD today... it’s his and @JLo’s 3 year anniversary. How you gonna top the thrill of that super bowl my guy??? 🤣😂

All had success and got fired. Some even got fired after they won Super Bowls. It’s part of the game. I rest my case. I’m gonna celebrate the rest of the week my team winning a Super Bowl. Bye
Vegas sportsbooks had one of their best Super Bowl Sundays ever yesterday... in case you were worried about them.

Congrats to JLo for being the first woman to win a Super Bowl.
For anyone that thinks the 3rd and 15 throw to Tyreek was wasn’t planned. Mahomes had been calling for it all game. #chiefs #SuperBowl https://t.co/qwqE6lDUvd

Katie Sowers coached a great game last night as the first woman to coach in the Super Bowl!
Finally, friendly reminder that you don't have to pit them against one another on who outperformed whom because they both did amazing. 

Just enjoy the performance, thanks!

If you thought there was something wrong with the Super Bowl halftime show, then you need to pick up a newspaper today and look at the date, because you’ve been living under a rock for the past 20 years.

I’ve spent the past two weeks in a state of disbelief that the Chiefs were playing in the Super Bowl... I wonder how long the disbelief that they actually won the Super Bowl will last! #SuperBowl #ChiefsKindgom
I just find it really ironic that one of my coworkers was “sick” during the superbowl and now another one is sick the day after
Hey guys I didn't watch the Superbowl plz stop asking me
@NotThatCuban I will. About to open a second Savings account just for the SuperBowl 😂
Awesome accomplishment , but shocked that hasn’t happened in a Super Bowl https://t.co/VYo6Nz6myL
The Super Bowl came and went. I’m outside walking around and it’s 60 and sunny out. Bring me baseball right fucking now!
@BradBiggs Also, I was disappointed that none of the fine Tribune reporters, yourself included, had a byline in this morning’s edition on the Super Bowl. Don’t like the trend in seeing so much talent being drained. What, in your opinion, does the future hold for @chicagotribune sports?
And Let's Get Loud for Jenny from the Block because she was ON THE FLOOR doing EVERYTHING! She was a HUSTLER!

@iceup89 Um, the Eagles won a Super Bowl.
Can’t wait to buy my #Chiefs replica Super Bowl ring from China 😂😂😉
The #Superbowl  #HalftimeShow reminded us that Shakira was THAT GIRL, is THAT GIRL, and will continue to be THAT GIRL. 

Her hips? They don't lie.

And you know what? She'll do it ALL FOR AFRICA!

@PatriotsKid @Gebe33Thomas I expected an epic top 5 Super Bowl.  It wasn’t Top 5 but it was a hell of a lot of fun and it was excellent start to finish.

@EddieTrunk @SuperBowl @NFL @gunsnroses It’s what I said to you last night.  Some powerful far left loon crazies are in control of the cancel pc culture.  Motley Crue were the bad boys with girls girls girls.  If they would have had the exact same thing on show they would have been banned for life and fined.
@rustyposey @katanna @SuperBowl @Hyundai @Porsche @Jeep I found myself looking for it.
The people complaining about the SuperBowl halftime show are the same who want to indulge in the culture for “family vacations”, eat the white washed version of Latinx food, fetishize them in adult content (all media really) &amp; inject their bodies/use spray tan to look like them.
I wish josh could go win the super bowl
Why every NON-Latino hating so much on the HISPANIC community taking over Super Bowl.  We be supporting everyone that has every performed black or white.  SMH times like these we should be working together and be proud of each other’s accomplishments. https://t.co/iNPLtK18QE

That google super bowl commercial went from sweet to really creepy. Why do I want google to know about my entire life? Going to use my info to make a Pixel phone Joey edition so my kids could know my past? Nope.

Looking to get out of certain tasks? Eat @ChesterCheetah this year’s super bowl ad uses rational appeal in showing how the orange stain left on the hands of anyone who eats the snack keeps one from touching many things. MC Hammer and his classic song helps add notoriety #NKUSBP

Now I’m seeing a lot of @Chiefs fan now. I dislike this so much! I’m sorry but I’m a die hard football fan. Never missed any game. But the #SuperBowl brings out fake fans.
@armyofskeletons A chunk of Kansas City (and its highest populated suburbs) IS in Kansas, and half of Missouri were Rams fans until just a couple seasons ago. It’s stupid to congratulate a state for a Super Bowl win, and it’s equally dumb for 12 hours of dunking on him about it.
Super Bowl Monday. Definitely feeling the weekend. I need a beer
@peter_king Zach Thomas not getting in when the super bowl is in Miami was the biggest miss this HoF class.
@LoJackson94 Can you show this stuff? 😂 Bill Walsh videotaped his team meetings, including sound and everything. They’re in a museum in SF. Check out Peyton’s Places on ESPN+. It’s informative, nostalgic &amp; funny. Makes that great 2019 @NFL 100 Super Bowl commercial even more meaningful.

2月2日晚，美国堪萨斯城酋长队KC夺得第54届美国橄榄球联盟(NFL)年度冠军赛“超级碗”(SuperBowl)冠军。KC四分卫帕特里克·马豪斯（15号球衣）获得本届“超级碗”的最有价值球员(MVP)称号。
迈阿密的硬石球场，KC逆转夺冠。在第四节10比20落后的情况下KC疯狂反扑，马霍姆斯带领球队完成三次达阵，31:20获胜。
This is exactly why I don’t watch anything put on by the NFL and I don’t give a flying damn who won the Super Bowl https://t.co/HaZqjpcl02

The best way to look this Super Bowl is through the lens of a complete team-wife fourth quarter stall. All components of the 49ers’ engine just stopped revving. The reasons behind that are complex, but credit does go to Reid’s methodical game plan and Jones, who lifted the KC D

Congratulations to the Kansas City Chiefs for winning Super Bowl LIV! As a 49’s fan, I’m sad our team didn’t win but you certainly earned the win. What a come back! Now you deserve to go to Disneyland! Californians will show you how amazing is our state. @Chiefs
@CheriseP1908 @maphead126 @Pornhub @SuperBowl They’re not ok? Really? They have nose bleeds and pass out or did they just ask questions and laugh? They’ll be fine.
Commander in Chief, one over the Niners going in the Super Bowl and won!!
They were a one-point favorite
Wanna talk about how "scandalous" #SuperBowl halftime show was? Don't forget to mention the menacing presence of the border wall backdrop or the isolated young singers emerging from their cages in harmony, stronger.

If you missed these things, you missed the point. @JLo @shakira
@JohnLegere The Puppy Bowl and the Kitten Bowl are my Superbowl forever.

@RaymondArroyo @amarcherrunge1 Sadly, sexually-charged entertainment by beautiful women only serves to both accentuate and perpetuate the sex-trafficking crimes taking place during Súper Bowl weekend.

Some said the 2018 Saints were a team of destiny. Some believed 2019's team was bound to win the big game on the 10-year anniversary of their previous victory in the same stadium. But next year it's personal for me. Next year's Super Bowl is my initials. LV. Who dat!

@primetime831 @NinersNation Teams who lose in the Súper bowl very rarely make it back in the following year.
@RaymondArroyo @amarcherrunge1 JLo &amp; Shakira are physical/athletic entertainers who are more dancers than singers as far as range. Modern dance is more sexually expressive than ballet.

My favorite thing about the #SuperBowl was all the Latinx and Lebanese excellence served up in mostly Spanish for all the racist white males that consume football. 💛✨
Ended 2-1 on the super bowl-0.7 unit's. CBB went -1.2 units 
Still up on the week but the weekend hurt. 
Still don't understand why SF didn't run the ball their last 3 possessions?
Regardless we had a great CFB/NFL season.
With Patrick Mahomes winning the Super Bowl, the Detroit Tigers have now drafted more Super Bowl winning QB’s than the Detroit Lions.

Just read an article thay the #SuperBowl attendance was low(est) it’s been for some time. 

Maybe it’s the absurd ticket prices and mixed with over priced hotel packages. 

Perhaps it’s time the @NFL and @nflcommish consider capping NFL experience pricing somehow.

Funny thing about the Chiefs winning the Super Bowl is, I’m seeing so much coverage about the 49ers. I’ve never seen a losing team get so much more attention. Mfs hate to say the Chiefs won ❤️💛
What I’ve learned today...  It’s racist to criticize the halftime performance at yesterday’s Super Bowl yet perfectly admirable to relish over someone announcing their fight with lung cancer. #HalftimeShow2020 #rushlimbaugh
@WillCainShow so which league has the most wins in Superbowl? NFC or AFC?
Imagine someone actually arguing w strangers all over the world on Twitter about the Super Bowl 😂💀
I literally just got paid to wave a Mickey bubble wand and see @PatrickMahomes in the super bowl parade at Magic Kingdom, what the heck!
@lanerodrigs1979 To be clear! JLo is a bad ass. Very talented in all forms of entertainment. They both put on a great show, but like any other performance one or the other comes out on top. Kind of like the Superbowl. Did the better team win?
@GQMagazine @GQSports Paul Rudd was actually alive when the Chiefs won their first Super Bowl, because he is extremely old.
@realDonaldTrump Now that’s a super bowl come back!
@DrewOnTheRadio @TheJohnSenning do you guys remember Shell’s seafood restaurant? They use to always be closed on #SuperBowl Sunday. But it was posted on the door all year.

If you wore a football jersey belonging to a team not named the Chiefs or 49ers to a Super Bowl party last night, you did it wrong.
I'm really frustrated to have to be under the weather this past weekend and unable to responsibly enjoy the Superbowl with my work peeps. Saga continues today and the weather is unseasonably warm. I'm still not 100% though. Really annoying.

The Super Bowl Halftime Show is destined for controversy no matter the artist. JLo and Shakiras performances were the ones they wanted to do and you can tell by how much fun they had.
Irony is Fox hosting the Super Bowl, then hosting all their news pundits complaining about their conglomerate’s halftime show. #all4ratings #fakeoutrage
Things I have yet to see in my lifetime:
- @NewYorkRedBulls win an #MLSCup and a CCL.
- @49ers win their sixth #SuperBowl.
- @miseleccionmx win a World Cup.
-  @USMNT win a World Cup.
I've seen so many people complaining about how sexual the superbowl halftime show was, but it was literally J-Lo and Shakira. What did you expect? I happen to think both of them are amazing and look better than me even if they're more than 2× my age. 
Just let people live, geez.

In fact, the Super Bowl had a commercial with kids playing football and then having them run the football into the stadium w/a group of kids.

@Yankeecowboy27 Oh yeah. I totally agree with ya that it was better than last year’s game no doubt. To me, the Super Bowl is something that I don’t get excited for anymore. The commercials in my opinion up until 5 years ago were funny and creative but in my opinion, they’re not anymore.

@MattWalshBlog As a kid growing up in the 70's, I had zero interest in the Super Bowl. Not everything has to be watered down for kids. It's okay for adults to enjoy mature content once in a while.

@MeekMill  was just havin a good time at the super bowl
@Roscoe_P_ Nah I’m not. Seeing people say that was the best super bowl performance wasn’t true in my opinion Michael Jackson and Prince had the best performances. BUT I can see how prideful and empowered Puerto Rican’s felt seeing that flag on stage. So I’m like hey let’s  just enjoy it 🤷🏾‍♂️
#sixers have been awful on the road. Embiid doesn’t seem anywhere close to 100 percent, and they were out in Miami last night for the super bowl. All signs point towards a loss. 

So I expect the Sixers to get a win tonight.

@AndrewBrandt Alex Smith will impact negotiations as much as winning the Super Bowl. Yeah, Dak, that goes for you, too.
If you want the easiest lock of all time, the 76ers are playing the Heat in Miami today after they were off yesterday and several of them went to the super bowl. Take the heat to cover and don’t look back

Super Bowl 54 continued to prove two things to me about the NFL.    1. Multiple talented pass rushers make your defense legit.
2. Great QBs give you a shot to win no matter what the deficit or circumstances are.

@Yashkhakhar13 He also threw for 286 yards, 2 TDs, ran for 45 yards (lost 16 on kneeling out) and a TD. He also became the youngest QB ever to win a super bowl &amp; SB MVP. You implying that Pat was shitty last night or what’s your point here? Cuz the guy on the other side threw a couple as well.

So many blown or lack of calls in this Super Bowl was odd. They swallowed their whistles and ate their flags. Not saying it was one way or the other, but the go ahead touchdown was a pick play with kelce blocking before the pass. Kittle OPI was appalling. That call is beyond rare

The funniest commercial of the Super Bowl was the Chris Evans, Rachel Dratch, John Krasinski "Smaht Pahk" one.

But my favorite commercial was definitely the Bill Murray Groundhog Day redux. Great to revisit that character and premise. ✌️🏈

#Best #SuperBowl #Commercials #
Let me get this right: we are upset and offended at two women showing strength, empowerment, and putting on a great show,  but are celebrating a team winning the Super Bowl who allows a known domestic abuser to stay on their team and has a problematic (at beast) mascot. 🤷🏻‍♀️
I didn’t watch the super bowl and as a comic, I left a lot of potential material on the table. .....So what’s with this 49 degree weather?
Past 6 SB runner ups:
2014 Broncos returned to win 2016 SB
2015 Seahawks made next 4/5 playoffs
2016 Panthers made next 1/4 playoffs
2017 Falcons made next 1/3 playoffs
2018 Patriots won the next SB
2019 Rams missed playoffs

A mixed bag. No consistent “super bowl hangover” tbh.

Alright gang, who is your money on in Iowa tonight? 

(This is the Super Bowl for nerds)
Democrats call out millionaires.

Football players, basketball, baseball and a few others make millions but no one says a word about that!

At the Super Bowl it cost $120 for a parking spot and tickets went up to $4,000 or more, but nothing is said about that!

Think about that!

...huh.

Women are somehow shockingly good at all kinds of things regardless of age. So crazy, right?!
y’all aren’t actually upset about the ass shaking and the pole dancing. y’all are mad that 4 latinx artists and an all latinx dance team gave one of the best super bowl performances in history (in spanish) and that’s that on that send tweet

Shakira who? I’M JOHN LAURENS IN THE PLACE TO BE.
Beginning to think that all who are complaining about the super bowl halftime show, haven’t mastered the remote control for their TV.
According to The Hollywood Reporter, the cost of a 30-second commercial during the 2020 Super Bowl is $5.6 million, up $400,000 from 2019. Commercials for the very first Super Bowl in 1966 cost $42,500, which is worth around $331,000 today when adjusted for inflation.

@KatieSowers @Chiefs @TheEllenShow That was a great #SuperBowl 
You and your team @49ers should be proud. And I’m sure you’ve had to tell a few people in your career to fuck off! Just keep doing that!! 🤘🏼😎🤘🏼

@realDonaldTrump you should send @shakira and @JLo a huge thanks for their SuperBowl Halftime Performance. Because now it’s all the Country can talk about! They totally nailed it! @NFL

Next time, Miami hosted Super Bowl, bring in Gloria Estefan and Miami Sound Machine

@Knabz210 And it has nothing to do with our sisters of color...the performance was another boring Super Bowl performance. I only tuned in because i thought JLo was going to slay and she didn’t.
@egreenmommy Your opinion is noted and not cared about. The Super Bowl is NOT for “families” it’s for 18-30 year olds. Go watch Sesame Street. Or send your kids out during half time. Stop tweeting stupid opinions.
@DebHaslam @letters4trump45 This was the real high point of the Super Bowl!  God bless them all!

My grandma said “they had a black girl sing the national anthem for the Super Bowl. She did a really good job”.

I didn’t watch it so I just went with what she said.

I just realized that she was talking about Demi Lovato. I am crying actual tears
don’t come at my relationship with God because I refuse to bash the super bowl halftime show💁🏼‍♀️💁🏼‍♀️
@TeamLastra @Christian_Racin But the Super Bowl next year will be on CBS so that won't be a problem
I get it, the Super Bowl was yesterday, cool. BUT yesterday was also Groundhog Day and Punxsutawney Phil predicted an early spring so be grateful and stop sleeping on him like that 🦦

@Evelyneezzy I mean don’t get me wrong y’all choked hella hard but it’s not like my raiders have came even close to a super bowl in nearly twenty years so 🤷🏻‍♂️
@SWarzecka @jasonmatheson If you are upset about the Super Bowl half show, but not the NFL cheerleaders and beer commercials. It is about something else, and you know what it is, just own it.

That high-pitched thing Shakira did with her tongue in the half-time show is called a zaghrouta. She also belly-danced and played strings from “Kashmir.” And sang the Arabic part of “Ojos Asi.” She’s Lebanese-Colombian. You just got Middle East-ed! https://t.co/rzpFLG4y4d

I'm trying so very, very hard to stay out of the Superbowl halftime debate but let me just say this one thing. It's a football game. I'd love to see a marching band, drumline, colorguard, steppers and dancers out there. Are you listening, @NFL?

My lord there is some negativity coming as a result of the Super Bowl. Geez people...relax...it’s all good 🧘‍♂️ ☮️ ✌🏽
Can’t believe people are more angry at two successful women supporting each other, celebrating culture, and being confident/in control of their bodies at the #SuperBowl Haltime Show than immigrant children being in cages (which is what part of the performance was in protest of).

@Eduardo180215 @marieflows @bennyaziz No. How do you know that more men watched the super bowl than women? If there are 3-4 women for each man, statistically either no women watched it, or more did to get that number. Statistically, that’s not close to accurate either, as the world is roughly 50.4% men to 49.6% women

or men married/stuck with the 50 year old Karens that are mad they can’t get a hot latina.

I NEVER DO THIS on social media, but this annoyed me. No one....literally not one human being on Earth cares about your opinion about the Super Bowl halftime show.  Those ladies killed it, and worked their asses off (no pun intended) their entire careers to be in a spot to have
Guys, the Chiefs won the Super Bowl. I'm still having trouble processing it.
@jeromec1985 Indoor has a shorter field and higher scoring. Both making those versions of the game interesting to watch. I watch a lot of college and NFL where I am fine with football being over by the time the super bowl comes. AAF was fun for one week and then was boring after.
This Super Bowl made a @Chiefs  fan for life! Thank you @PatrickMahomes for a great amazing all star come back! #alittlelate #2020 #newyear #nfl

@AmicaAli I didn’t see anything wrong at all with the Super Bowl halftime show. The dancers on dancing with the stars sometimes wear less than that. I’m just always impressed how everything stays in place when they’re hopping around and doing the shimmy shimmy.  💃

@kristinbcb It’s like a Super Bowl against New England: once the main event comes, it’s enough for the opponent to just not be them.
I can’t believe people are complaining about the Super Bowl halftime show still.  It’s the same thing every year, loud music and a light show.

He is right.
How about we just start February over? #SuperBowl #IAcaucus

They showed Trumps face in a Super bowl commercial and my 8 and 12  year old sisters freaked out. Trump has years of sexual misconduct but ok 2 latinas bringing latin culture to the Super bowl was explicit. Yeah right. https://t.co/96LUV9dJFF
Goddammit I fell asleep in the third quarter of the Super Bowl but I stay awake for the horseshit Iowa caucuses?

IMAGINE THIS. IT’S 2020 &amp; SOMEONE IN AMERICA IS OFFENDED BY THE SUPER BOWL HALF TIME SHOW.
During the 3.5 million dollar taxpayers fundead  Super Bowl party at Mar-A-Lago, @realDonaldTrump was filmed goofing and acting like he was conducting a band;  while everyone  around him stood still during the anthem.

Pretty sure the Super Bowl halftime show made everyone gay and I love that for America
In 2005 Jacksonville hosted the Super Bowl and Paul McCartney played the half time show. 

I will take Columbian Dolly Parton, JLO on a pole, &amp; Ashanti’s vocals over the guy from Wings any day.
Kinda sad shakira didn’t sing Loca at the super bowl 🥺
If y'all are ever losing bad during a set, remember that the 49ers at one point had a 96.1% chance of winning the Super Bowl and lost.
@peterbakernyt Bead Parscale at the urbandale caucus bragged about AirForce1, mar-a-lago, and Super Bowl as perks of being president &amp; reasons to vote for Trump.  I don’t think he gives a rat’s ass about healthcare.
Works out for Joe that Kansas fans are too busy celebrating the Super Bowl to care about this insult. https://t.co/BaCnbm15nW
but the real question is will president trump lose voters in missouri after congratulating the state of kansas on the chiefs super bowl win???? could prove costly during an election year
Today, two years ago, was the greatest day in Philadelphia Sports history #Eagles #superbowl 🦅🦅
Basically I felt as though the Super Bowl LIV @pepsi halftime show was fun, cultured, message-driven, and impressive. Not everything has to be a debate. Sometimes, it’s okay to just enjoy performers and their talents (and their “Born in the USA” messages 😊).

I’m genuinely confused and frustrated by the negative reaction to the #HalftimeShow. The dancing and costumes were no different than any other recent #SuperBowl performance, which raises the question: what are people really mad about?

Power out all day. At 10p I see LADWP lights, go out to tell them I heard a boom at 1pm (but didn’t see anything) Turns out it WAS a thing and calling it in would have helped.

@pnjaban Pretty much @NFL &amp; @PepsiCo @pepsi received exactly what it paid for from @JLo and @shakira especially given that the backdrop was primetime in Miami, the @SuperBowl #SuperBowlLIV notwithstanding. You can bet that it wasn't a well kept secret from the League office or @FOXSports!

0 INTs in 5 Super Bowls is impressive as hell.

Like seriously I live not to far from the #hardrockstadium and I live in Broward county. The #SuperBowlLIV was boring for me to watch. Hell I now for in fact that the team's that aren't so good can do better than the Superbowl Game.

This feels like a regular season game to me.
I never make predictions this boldly. 2 years ago, I posted this to FB as soon as I rolled out of bed on Super Bowl Sunday. I watched that game with my then 4-year old, my wife, and my father, and we adults toasted my grandfather with a shot. https://t.co/3RstoM3wps

I'm seeing red. Idk how to respond without doing real, irreversible damage...
Guess the first team practices against thin air for two weeks to prepare for the Super Bowl... Smh 🤦‍♂️ https://t.co/4OPwwX3Jpy

@freddyatton Has this person been living on another planet? Um the super bowl party with him disrespecting our National Anthem is all over social media. Proof enough?
The Karens and Beckys on Facebook are upset about the super bowl halftime show being a bad influence for their kids but preach that the president, who bullies people on the bird app and brags about sexually assaulting women, was sent by God himself to save America.

@BethMosher5 Super bowl half time should  be family oriented &amp; uplifting. 
This was a sexually, titillating adult theme which is not representative 
of America.
The “stars” are exceptional entertainers but could have performed a different genre which would have been more appropriate.
Wondering if Wal-Mart modified the background music in their Super Bowl commercial just enough in hopes of avoiding paying Elton John royalties. Doubt it, but these are things I think of two days later.
@libertyrun1212 It'll go back up, Shakira got a temporary bump post her awesome Super Bowl performance...
@gil_in_atx @SouthSoundShane @bennyaziz @travismclark Typically, global figures for Superbowl add no more than 50-60% on top of domestic meaning more people around the world watch most of the mens World Cup matches or a big Premier League game twice a year than Superbowl. 

There is no comparison.

@DJ6Minutes Agreed just like ATL'iens would've loved to see OutKast, Goodie Mobb, etc. at the super bowl in Atlanta. It's a performance that'll be seen around the world their not pushing a black agenda on a platform that large! It's the NFL niggas should know better!
I know we just won the Super Bowl and I may be getting ahead of myself, but is there anyway we move up in the draft and get @KennethMurray? @Chiefs
@Rubencasabona ALSO, just realized we had a Miami super bowl with no Florida Stanley!!! A crying shame.
Looking forward to the SuperBowl commercial of this Google Photos feature. https://t.co/fNTlrZItqY
Maybe Verizon should have taken the 5G from the Super Bowl and saved it for Iowa 🤷🏻‍♀️
Super Bowl in Tampa next year. I'm in there for sure
Happy the Super Bowl is over...

We can move forward with free agency and the draft.

Lots of work for Howie.

NKeal Harry was hurt half this year but he’s going to be good. No 1st or 2nd rd picks in 2017. Altogether Pats will take one Super Bowl win.

How disgusting was Trump’s behavior during the national anthem at his $3.4 million Super Bowl party? He mocked the Star Spangled Banner whilst Melania and Barron remained frozen with embarrassment.

Wow Miami, what a show from @centerplate @HardRockStadium @SuperBowl and @NFL some of the best food seen in venues in years.  Great Job!! Now to @JLo and @shakira "Amazing" the best @SuperBowl show in the last 10 years.  I vote you both go on tour.

I’m a Dak fan, but if the goal is a Super Bowl for Dallas and Tom Brady is available....isn’t that the best fit! I get the age difference but if Tom is playing he still gives you a chance to win, and the Cowboys can always develop a young QB under Brady. @Espngreeny @GetUpESPN

I’d like to declare that I was actually the real MVP of the Super Bowl. Sorry, @PatrickMahomes. You played good tho.
@Go_Dan_Go @hbryant42 I don't think they'll win a Superbowl until the McCaskey's sell the team. They aren't motivated to win. They're content watching the money pile up, on-field (&amp; front office) performance isn't too big a deal.

@us_sams @PatrickMahomes “Defeat Into Victory”, a fitting analogy for this Super Bowl! Teamwork, training, focus, and understanding the opponent’s goals and tactics....I see what you did there.

@Paydirt_DFS @patrickallendfs @friscojosh So you are saying you need an elite QB to win the SuperBowl? That’s a different argument than not having or having a balance attack.. even though again I’d bring up Noodle arm Brady vs Panthers and Foles.. but over a period of time I get you.. but that’s a different argument

@mschlapp Thing is, it’s not just a technicality that the stadium isn’t in Kansas, the main CITY is in Missouri. The postcard skyline, the Plaza, the art museums, the Super Bowl parade...most everything “Kansas City.” The Kansas side has its contributions but the city is in Missouri.
@friscojosh @Paydirt_DFS @patrickallendfs So what did you come away with from last years SuperBowl? Or the Broncos Panthers SuperBowl? Let me guess.. Broncos weren’t balanced because Manning couldn’t throw a 12 yard out. So they won because of their defense with no balance https://t.co/mPYcgWU7R2

1. There’s only 1 Mahomes in the NFL 

2. The patriots just won a SuperBowl LAST YEAR by dominating an “offensive juggernaut” and that was coming off of beating the Chiefs. 

So at the end of the day, teams can win how they win. It’s about executing your style of play
I wish they could count the times that the Super Bowl is rewatched just in Chiefs Kingdom in the next year. *The number does not exist*

@JLo Ate the super Bowl 2020💃🏽 https://t.co/ma8tORDKAa
@CheriJacobus @RD3001 You're not going to "win" so it's best to let it go. You won't change people's minds. The Super Bowl is an adult show, always has been. They advertise alcohol, car insurance, and cialis - not Disney princess toys. There's an off switch on the remote.
Can we move on from the super bowl now?
@CiannaElizabeth yikes! I didn’t use to be allergic, but halfway through Refugio’s life started having issues. Our friends whose house we went to for the super bowl had a cat and I had issues, but I don’t always, just sometimes!
Which do “conservative” White evangelicals find more offensive:

1) The 2020 Super Bowl halftime show, or

2) A president who cheated on his wife with a porn model?

Franklin Graham says (1).

So who else thought that this superbowl halftime show was wack
Within the past few days I have spent considerable time vehemently defending JLo and Shakira’s Super Bowl halftime show AND weeping while watching the Taylor Swift documentary. I know these women are all very rich and powerful and don’t need me in any way but I love them so much!
After watching the Super Bowl, my 2 y old daughter is now chanting for the 49ners all over the house. She doesn’t know they lost but thats just what she absorbed from the experience, She could care less about the half time show.
Wow even middle schoolers think #Shakira won the #SuperBowl. Sorry chiefs lol
Soooooo....on Facebook there is a craze going on that the Kansas City Chiefs winning the Superbowl spells revival🙄

It’s amazing how SHOCKED everyone is over the Super Bowl Halftime Show. 

@JLo &amp; @shakira performed their asses off representing their culture. I’m so sorry that y’all literally know NOTHING and can’t accept our culture! We are all different and there is NOTHING wrong with that.

#Herdgaroppolo for me it’s fun to bash Shanahan for because he’s smug, but he’s the reason why the 49ers made it to Super Bowl.

trading Von Miller must become more and more of a conceivable notion for #Broncos fans when considering the future of the team. You’re paying him Top-10 money and he is not a quarterback. The #Broncos are shifting away from their Super Bowl 50 defense and it will give Chubb shine
The “I’m going to Disney World!” Super Bowl campaign originated after @Michael_Eisner had dinner with Dick Rutan &amp; Jeana Yeager after they completed their around the world non-stop flight. Eisner asked Rutan what he was gonna do next. Rutan responded, “I’m going to Disneyland!”

Superbowl halftime has become an ass crotch fest. Orgasmic contortions, pole dancing, twirking, humping, crotch grinding, tits bouncing! Is this our best talent? The show gets racier every year. What's next? Is Superbowl a sports event or a ceremonial orgy?
@jimrome My beef today? Our president, who chastised anthem-kneelers as traitorous, playing the imaginary band and doing the ‘I see you’ with some other yuppie at his taxpayer (of which he hasn’t been in decades) funded $4mil super bowl party.

Personally, I felt the super bowl halftime show didn’t have enough crotch grabbing.
Professor in college describing super bowl halftime show - “shakiras ass was in my face the whole time I loved it”
Do not ask about the halftime show IF YOU are a hypocrite who believes it’s socially acceptable for men to walk around half naked swinging their junk everywhere OR you think the Super Bowl should not be used a political platform.

No chance I can respect her again, even working under her “leadership.”
@smartsusie @ProudResister the message that comes across is...Let me dress almost naked and dance this way And don't think about me sexually. My bigger problem was where this happened. At the Super Bowl. Note they dressed and danced more conservatively when kids were out. Was lovely.

@breakingtco @richeisen @RichEisenShow @Broncos @Marlins_Man @peter_king @ProFootballHOF @NFL @MIASBLIV @psmyth12 Thank you - big props to Peter/y'all for making the time to offer such unique events like this during a hectic #SuperBowl Week.

Did you see the New York Life #SuperBowl ad that mentioned the four loves? The clergy hot takes were the best! Anyway, I wrote a thing on this for @RNS at the urging of @bobsmietana. Mostly because they misconstrued the meaning of agape love... https://t.co/WCz1fHyXrB
This is great 2:20 to listen to right after the Super Bowl on so many levels! Chiefs OC Eric Bienemy is a phenomenal coach! https://t.co/tvKdSAkqte
interesting how so many people can be criticized for not respecting the national anthem, but when trump attends the Super Bowl and can’t even humble himself to do it, no one talks about it

@IsaacSJ408 I mean they did just lose the super bowl.
@oohpujie Yeah. It’s a bad stump speech. I also hated the speech he gave at the Super Bowl watch party where he encouraged people to “just skip that shift” or “pull it together” for child care to go caucus. Very dismissive of people who can’t just skip a shift!
That EDM mix of Mi Gente kinda slapped

Same moms upset about this years super bowl the same ones drooling of Adam Levine last year.  So this ain’t even accurate. https://t.co/ZjZiVH0dj3
The ratings say more people tuned in to the Halftime show than the actual game itself. A lot of people may hate the Patriots (they whine about how the team always wins), but these haters also secretly want NE to be in the Super Bowl. But only for the other team to beat them. https://t.co/eGy2Dp9ghh
The beautiful &amp; amazing @MsDuffgirl &amp; I got together 19 years ago, the day after the Super Bowl. We celebrated our first anniversary as world champions last night.

@chocobastic23 @kcsith88 @cubbystrickland He did. He called last years super bowl when the phantom holding call against Sullivan that negated Gurley's run that would have put rams inside the 20. Diffrence between us and saints and 49ers fans is we dont get on twitter and cry about it.
@SportsRadioWIP Top this WIP. I watched the NFL 31 minute Super Bowl #52 highlight video last night! It made me think of Doug's comment at the parade. Get used to this it's the new normal. Well I guess next year we will be seeing a parade again. After all another SB inside of 3 years is normal. https://t.co/3aJlxNaeVa
@ScottFaldon Pete Rozell once told staffers after Super Bowl X there were 3 words her never wanted spoken of again - “Up. With. People.”

@chrisShochet Stupid idea for next year, have two tweets before the Super Bowl starts each one saying that x team is gonna win. Step 2. Once game ends delete the other tweet and act like you supported the winners the entire time. Step 3 profit?
Disregard that last tweet. I’m a little stupid... but uh, Chiefs still winning dat shit. Super bowl 55.

@karaswisher Scott was so right about the Bloomberg ad.  Let's play a anti gun ad to a bunch of beer drinking, gun loving football fans.  People of all ideals watch the Superbowl, but Dems HAVE to stop speaking to the people, like me, who will vote Trump out anyway.

Andy Reid cemented his Hall of Fame resume with a #SuperBowl victory, but in no way should he be enshrined in Canton at the @ProFootballHOF before Mike Holmgren. Reid would probably say the same thing.

Curious to see what kind of effect the Super Bowl has on the winning team's social media? 

I broke down the @Chiefs and 49ers social performance from Sunday and compared them to regular season averages.  Download the full report here. https://t.co/QmHxmHR2YN

The Niners won the Super Bowl!

…

BREAKING: I was speaking figuratively when I said the Niners won the Super Bowl. What I meant was that it was a victory *for them* to come in second place.
They stole that money from those strippers for the super bowl through contract.. meanwhile random people walking out with stacks. 😂😂
@FieldGulls Does anyone remember how well he played in the second half of the superbowl against the Pat's? Just curious if he let any plays happen that made them come back.
I’m forever heartbroken over that super bowl 💔
@DisneylandToday to all the cast members and the guests  how was your Super Bowl Sunday and have a great week sending you love pixie dust in no matter who we are in this world we love each other of all ages  sending you more magic and happiness

What’s the BEST commercial you’ve ever seen? 📺 

Reply with your favorite 😆
Dos jugadas similares:
La 1ra Wild Card: Vikings vs Saints y no se marca Interferencia = TD Vikings

La 2da Super Bowl: Marcan interferencia a George Kittle = 0pts

Increíble que las Zebras 🦓 de la #NFL tenga distinto criterio o acaso esta “arreglado”

@william_pitts I don’t recall any complaints when Adam Levine tore off his shirt during his super bowl performance.
I agree that Jennifer Lopez and Shakira put on a pretty good performance, but I’m with @deesnider on this. Rock music is synonymous with football. I’m all for an all rock/metal Super Bowl Halftime Show and it’s a long time coming.

His draft classes make me take away my sarcasm because I can’t even joke about how bad this decision is ... if he was truly in control as Gms usually are I understand why the 49ers dropped so far after getting to the super bowl
@karmamegs Usually I could do the same, but I was cooking, tasting, having who could eat the most contest, on superbowl.  I had to eat like 100 wings that day. Felt like doug heffernan trying to win my friend back on "king of queens".

it ALWAYS has to be about Trump.

Just look at him “conducting” the National Anthem for the Super Bowl.

Or the sit-down he did w/ @seanhannity that aired a couple of hours before kick-off.

I wish he would just keel over &amp; become a vegetable that shits himself ALL THE TIME https://t.co/OccmpjH34z
Charli Damelio is 15 and tik tok famous and starring in super bowl commercials, I was 15 and getting alcohol poisoning every weekend and disappointing my parents we are not the same
Kaepernick brings awareness to racism by kneeling during the anthem, but ppl cry anti-American and demand @NFL to take action or else they will boycott. 

But when every year #SuperBowl #HalftimeShow is full of debauchery and illuminati, they complain one day
Anyone know where the @49ers bang bang gang is? They were missing from their teams arrival home. They need support but I guess all the “die hard” fans fell off the wagon. #BangBangNinerGang #BandWagon #SuperBowl #FairWeatherFans https://t.co/CtfIayTT6T
The family friendly debate about the super bowl halftime show is tired. Stop coming up with reasons to bring down powerful women.
Where is the @TheRealFrankC_  micd up super bowl videos at?!!!
Wonderful. Go last week being bed ridden with an illness. Recover for the Super Bowl and get sick again when the Bolts finally come home from a long road trip. I am so tired of being sick. Coverage from the confines of home tonight, folks. Hopefully Thursday will be better.
Still can’t believe Los Tigers Del Norte really opened at the Super Bowl
I just rewatched Shakira and J Lo’s amazing #SuperBowl half time show and then YouTube got me into a hole and I ended up watching 4 or 5 more. Coldplay was smart to add Beyoncé and Bruno Mars. Conclusion: If you don’t dance, send for back up or don’t bother! 😘
Thought I just had a couple days at work to milk this Super Bowl thing in.

Was just told I have a couple months. No one is safe.

Went to the local watering hole to watch the Superbowl, started hanging with a new neighbor from Boston. When a drunk guy was bothering him he pointed his finger in the opposite direction and said "Screw!". Which I took to be Boston for "Fuck off".

I have to start using that.

It just depends on so many things. Peyton Manning had the lowest passer rating in the NFL and won the Super Bowl because he had an incredible defense. The Bears had a chance in 2018 because of the same thing. To have a sustained run, you need a top 10 QB. https://t.co/4uimUhPePp

@epatrissii Yes, because women in pop culture are almost always using their bodies as a tool to gain more fame, like j-lo or shakira at the super bowl, and other women dont seem to mind when they comment shit like "slay queen" or "yass"

Me: “I bet putting the Super Bowl trophy in Jimmy G’s hand while he throws it blind to the Chiefs would be pretty funny”

Super Bowl XLIX halftime show was Katy Perry featuring Lenny Kravitz and Missy Elliott. Why not boycott @Star1021 where they play Katy Perry ALL THE TIME? According to Tim, Katy kissing a girl = bad, @realDonaldTrump conducting an imaginary band during #NationalAnthem = Great! https://t.co/Fnhh2GlCe2
For people upset by the Super Bowl half time, it was shakira and J-Lo, Shakiras biggest hit is a song called “Hips Dont Lie”.  Ya should’ve seen it coming
I’ve watched the Disney+ Super Bowl trailer countless times now and I can say, I will watch WandaVision but I stand by my original statement that I would rather have twice as many #FalconAndWinterSoldier episodes. Even better if Bucky has on that blue shirt in all of them. https://t.co/VJzvS6nDPc

While there were endless events, concerts, and parties...this was by far my favorite moment from SB week. Thousands of people gathering in the heart of Miami on Super Bowl Sunday to worship one name...Jesus.

Tony Mazz really said he could tell brady he wanted to leave by the way he spoke to Jim Gray on SuperBowl Sunday 🤷‍♂️. People should pay no attention to their fake narratives! They want Tom to leave just got the story
@piersmorgan There's also a ton of drinking and gambling that goes along with the superbowl. Not everything's geared towards 10 year olds. The halftime show was really fun to watch.

@makusdhy @ximerincon Ni ahí con esas dos cantantes, pero el número del intermedio del superbowl, no paga nada a los artistas, solo pagos administrativos. Ya que el solo hecho de que un artista se presente ahí, ya se siente pagado por los millones que recibirá post show.

Why doesn't someone with access and $$$ make an ad with trump's Superbowl party "performance" conducting our National Anthem, right before his State of the Union address? After all, that's who he is, right? FAKE????

So are we really a marketing agency if we didn’t post a list of our favorite Super Bowl ads? 🤔

 #marketingagency
I really enjoyed shakira in the super bowl performance. JLo....... lol
@ur_lake_opossum @SabrinasNYC I have no idea but I blame the media and their contacts SuperBowl like election coverage for overblowing the Iowa caucus.
DUES PAID!!!🥵 1400 pushups OWED because I KNEW last week, the 49ers were going to WIN the Super Bowl! #PayupSucker On the + side, I am enjoying my case of severe SWOLEEEosis! 💪🏽 #GETSOME👊🏽©️

Super Bowl #7 
Pass the torch 
Fade off into the sunset 

Alarm goes off and I wake up to find he’s on the Jets.
@udatwit We don't know that for sure yet.

And if you want to run the worse case scenario, at least get it straight: it won't be the Superbowl, it will be all the Superbowl PARTIES that sparked it all in the States.
got on facebook. saw my mom posted that shakira and j-lo looked “trashy” during the super bowl. immediately logged off facebook.
All these old angry white folks bitching about the super bowl halftime show as if Justin Timberlake never whipped out Janet Jackson’s tiddy in the 2004 halftime show. We’ve seen much more than just a lil #buttclevage. Grow up.
NOW THIS:

The winner of the next Super Bowl will be declared by which team wins the coin toss followed by a half time show..
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS @SuperBowl @foxnetworks Not an interview, an ad. 
Hard to determine which of you is the bigger idiot: you or Hannity. Close race but I think you pulled out a win.
We are 2 days removed from my @49ers #SuperBowl loss and I’m still not okay! 😣 #stillsucks #Niners
So apparently during the Super Bowl there was a rogue @NFLFilms camera on me wildin’ throughout the game. I need that footage...because I do NOT know what I did.  I was VERY hype...and wearing zubaz...and might have been running around trying to get an entire section fired up.

@joebonsall @NFL @ericchurch @mirandalambert @littlebigtown @kennychesney That's exactly what I said the Super Bowl should do. And include the Oaks.
just remembered I took a screenshot of this conversation during the Super Bowl. Find you a hype man / bf like @dakotajaniece https://t.co/YyinVm8Ofo
"No, #JLo and #Shakira were not too sexy. They were just too Latina for racist, middle America to absorb. Both women have strong backgrounds in dance – so yes, they will be seen in performance dance costumes with sequins and sazon".  

https://t.co/2ogkdxAeIi
You see a guy like DLo who was once recording teammates on Snapchat now being able to handle his name being in trade talks with the utmost professionalism.

@InspiringU2 oh dear God @EricTrump Is really a full-blown idiot, he deserves all of the jabs that he gets from the comedians.

@USATODAY @usatodayopinion Absolutely! A half-time show that had many terrible surprises. I can tell you people will not be watching the Super Bowl next year if they can't get it under control. You had Beyonce and her show against our policemen, etc. Now the vulgar n negatively about, wall, immigration.Sad
@JeffGordonWeb @ClintBowyer @49ers @NASCARONFOX @SuperBowl @FOXTV Please burn the chief's Jersey after the broadcast. :)
necesito saber si opinaron ya de lo sucedido en el halftime del Súper bowl ya que siempre opinan de todo
Mahomes is the post season MVP but Damien Williams was the Super Bowl MVP. Dude had such a good game, so many clutch plays. Wouldn’t have been the same game without him.

If it wasn’t enough that everyone and their brother has criticized the half time show for the women shaking their butts &amp; their outfits being too revealing now PETA has to throw in their unwanted 2 cents! 🤦🏼‍♀️
@RealAssTalkNow He did and his f**king ad was the lowest rated of all Super Bowl ads😂
@JayTToler He’s the Landlord SuperBowl Champ!

My #SuperBowl in a nutshell:

1. Order a gigantic ‘Game Day’ meal meant for 6-8 ppl just for myself. 

2. Not watch the actual game. 

3. Read all the Halftime Show memes on Twitter. 

4. Put on Netflix.

GO sports! 🏈
@TheOneTAR I am flying right before the Super Bowl starts and landing an hour before it ends so I should get home just in time to miss it entirely.  However since the bengals are my favourite team I’m used to missing the super bowl.

Also, maybe don’t hide this in a 3pm Sunday afternoon game the same day as the Super Bowl. Seems like the whole thing was an afterthought and that’s disappointing. https://t.co/eF3iblo6Dn
Omg, I have cobbled together a solution!

$80 Amazon projector
Play kitchen (projector stand)
Bedsheet tacked to ceiling
Foil over windows
Chromecast
25' audio cable
3' audio adapter
Soundbar

Honestly, this is will be great.

One of the best #SuperBowl traditions is to follow @BaldBryan as he brings to light all the "too cool for school" kids who use the term #sportsball today as though they're being funny.
Its Superbowl day. As a Seahawks fan, I really can't(shouldn't)cheer for the Niners. And I dated a guy from Missouri who was a Chiefs fan, that was THE MOST fuqed up relationship/breakup, so that makes me not want to have any "like" for the Chiefs.
Maybe a movie day instead!?

I was 8yrs old, went to @ronlawn house to watch the #49ers play the Cwbys in the 1981 NFC title game. “The Catch” made me a life long #49ers fan.  It’s been an outstanding season so far. Finish strong today boys!!! Cheering from Saskatoon!@49ers @melissa_g_willy @SuperBowl https://t.co/zRmuxZ6YE8
Ground Hog day in Abbotsford BC, yes he saw his Shadow.  = 6 more wks. of winter.

“The average cost of a 30-second commercial during the Super Bowl has ranged from $37,500 at SBI to around $2.2 mil at SBXXXIV in 2000. By SBXLIX in 2015, the cost had doubled to around $4.5 mil, and by SB LIV in 2020, the cost had reached $5.6 mil for a 30-second slot.” 💸💸💸

@kerette45 I’m a #Broncos fan and am absolutely cheering for the Chiefs. They are a young, fun and exciting team. Whether or not they win the Super Bowl, just by being there will hopefully speed up the Broncos re-building process. Some people need to realize this is just a game 🤦🏽‍♀️
Another year, another #SuperBowl prediction 🏈

Pro-Trump commercials 🖕🏽🖕🏽 #SuperBowlLIV #Superbowl
I’m just here killing time watching the #SuperBowl until #DoctorWho starts at eight. 🤷🏻‍♂️
Maybe it's just me 🤷 I've watched the Superbowl many times, watched football games, had people explain it to me watched videos, but I honestly don't understand a thing that goes on. I spend the whole game trying to figure out what's happening 🤦 year after year
A PRO TRUMP SUPERBOWL COMMERCIAL LOFUCKINGL
That Fast 9 commercial during the Superbowl removed John Cena.
That #SuperBowl Tide commercial made me 🤣🤣🤣👌
Stopped by the firehall this afternoon. They were well into a Superbowl foodfest. Lots of greasy cheese and joking around. Camaraderie and laughter help keep a crew tight and on the same page. #torontofirefighters

The Super Bowl National Anthem choked me up &amp; I imagined how emotionally overwhelming it must be for the players. Prior to that I recognized a depression flare-up. I feel like curling up in the fetal position &amp; crying. I'll be fine.
@AprilEhler @ScottNotInVAN @hustlerama @DarshanVancity @sportsrage @nik_kowalski @soonerleesa As tradition being my I think 4th #SuperBowl of doing this. I always time the American National anthem and post the time the friends that have placed a bet on this gambling line.
So wait they are actually playing a #SuperBowl without the @Patriots ? Isn’t that against the rules? Okay while we debate that, I am riding with @Chiefs

Kyle Shanahan’s clock management has been a touching tribute to Andy Reid and it’s even brought John Lynch to his feet.

Just saw @bigmouthsports's son in a Diet Coke Super Bowl commercial. Unreal!!! That's my guy
Football is like a religion to me—i.e., something I haven’t followed with any regularity since I was a teen. So watching the Super Bowl is kinda like going back to shul for your cousin’s kid’s bar mitzvah—nice, but mostly you’re just like “who the fuck are all these people?”
Without seeing the other ads I can already say this wins the Superbowl this year! https://t.co/dnrqXMkFmA

Mahomes: I’mma just run this TD in myself 🤷🏾‍♂️

@LucasHrynyk I just showed this to everyone at our super bowl party 10/10 😂😂

So, that 100 Huntley Street commercial was such a creative ad on the Super Bowl... thanks @CTV. 🙄 It’s stupid that we can’t watch the US commercials even on a US channel. #crtcsucks #SuperBowlCanada
I missed the #SuperBowl. Sporting events did not make it highly on our weekend’s priority list.
This #SuperBowl is just making me want to take a vacation down to #Miami so bad.  It looks beautiful 😍 plus it has hot weather and I'd do anything to get away from this snow..
I wonder how long rehearsals ran for this performance.

Omg the ongoing #Tide commercial throughout the #SuperBowl is hilarious. Like, will he get to wash his shirt eventually?! The suspense is killing me 😂
So, as far as Twitter is concerned, the Super Bowl halftime show was Shakira flicking her tongue at the camera and her and J-Lo shaking their asses.
Never seen such a polarized reaction to a super bowl half time show. People saying it’s either the best one ever or the worst.

GOP Senators and the NFL - cut from the same cloth, and running the same plays. It’s disgusting and dangerous, and they will both continue to do it as long as the public lets them.

It’s been 3 years since I watched or supported the NFL in any way.

Well it was a fun SuperBowl. Now for me the focus goes strictly on the @Avalanche and the @PGATOUR and @EuropeanTour golf seasons! Hit one winner and a couple top 5’s so far let’s get one this week at Pebble!! Let’s see what the odds will be but im leaning towards one name.... https://t.co/NN4RihXw5x
My only thoughts on the Super Bowl: Shakira and J Lo can literally do whatever they want forever https://t.co/cS3Iv4Nk1L
@thetexasboy91 He just pulled the same choke show against the @Patriots? Remember he did the same mistake when he was with the @AtlantaFalcons in the last time he was in the Super Bowl which his team blown a 28-3.
These are the only #SuperbOwl stats I give a fuck about. https://t.co/SriNwJJ7xU

Hope to see you do a guest rotation at the Ottawa Civic ER one day!
Spent the #SuperBowl plotting out a new story. 
Is it a story being original, or the execution that counts the most?
I still can’t process why North Americans call rugby 🏈 football? And call “real football” “soccer”? This doesn’t make any sense to me. Football is something you play with your feet 🦶
#superBowl
So, for those enjoying the SuperBowl you should probably pay attention to what the @Chiefs fandom says to Indigenous folx. 

This is our reality.
This is what we still have to deal with.
But we should be honoured right?!

But but all means enjoy your damn game.

He’s a medical doctor, and now .@mcgillu alum, Canadian Laurent Duvernay-Tardif is a Super Bowl Champion.  https://t.co/cIZgj5IvvP via @torontostar
I fell asleep before the #SuperBowl Halftime Show. 🤣
@KyleBrandt @gmfb Just wondering if you and the crew think that Damien Williams should have or at least could have been the MVP of the super bowl. 2 touchdowns around 140 yards and some really nice angry runs.
@stephenasmith gon have a big smile on his face this morning after that SuperBowl 😁
Omg, I didn't watch the super bowl, but I'm sad I missed this ad with Maisie singing! https://t.co/ArFdoeJ238
I’d be lying if I said @JLo and @shakira were not the reason for my intense booty workout this morning. #SuperBowl #SuperBowlLIV #gay
Good Morning Toronto! 

Thank you for this day 
and #SuperBowl half time shows 

#groundhog day was great too!
Bcp de parieurs de @miseojeu l’avaient prédit : les Chiefs de Kansas City et @LaurentDTardif étaient favoris pour gagner le #superbowl. Nous attendons les derniers chiffres pour confirmer, mais ce fut fort probablement l’événement le plus populaire de l’histoire de Mise-o-jeu. https://t.co/4GXE28jEkn
Am I the only one who didn't watch the super bowl?

Did you watch the Superbowl? ☑️ ❎
Remember that time when Damien Willams scored a 38 yard touchdown to seal Super Bowl 54?? Feels like it was just yesterday!! #ChiefsKingdom #FinishedBusiness

@ManneLess Youhou! Pour le superbowl, les Chiefs étaient en rouge. De plus, le tableau indique un match Patriots VS Chiefs. #fakepic
That was a well played Super Bowl.

When that Chiefs light switch goes on ...
Nobody cares about your Superbowl hot take.
Attended a Super Bowl watch party yesterday. 

Out of 7 people including me, the average age was 30

4/7 were commercial bankers 

2/7 were teachers, one in school to become a teacher. 

The only people in their 20s were me(23) and a younger gent(20). #SuperBowlLIV
No lie I was waiting for Ja Rule to come out during the super bowl performance.
Shout out @49ers
Y'all did what you could
#GoodGame #SuperBowl
Things that I learned last night during the game: 

- Jimmy G a fraud.
- Kyle Shanahan is a choker in the 4th.
- Undrafted RB’s were the stars of the Super Bowl.
Je suis czi cmt JLo s'est changé plusieurs fois pendant le superbowl. J'ai l'impression qu'elle a plusieurs dates 🤣🤣🤣

Such a brilliant eye opening article 👏👏👏 “To a 49er miner, an Indigenous woman or child was nothing more than a pick-ax — when it broke, you simply had to buy a new one.”  Being a Canadian with no interest in sports I had no idea where the name 49ers came from 😳 #SuperBowl https://t.co/RREvCofJAC

@retroscotty1 @Chiefs @SuperBowl Oh I remember this feeling from 7 years ago. 😕
@MacMallyMMA @DaveBets_ There is an event every two weeks. Super bowl is once a year. Sport doesn’t have that magnitude of a following yet
The cheifs superbowl win comes across as cheap. A welfare superbowl.
A superbowl without the Patriots in it is not a good superbowl.
Next year’s @Ravens vs @packers @SuperBowl will be crazy.
I guarantee you, during the whole Superbowl halftime show, the ONLY thing on people’s minds were “What is their skincare routine”. There, I said it. Don’t @ me
Glad to see everyone on Twitter last night updating me on the super bowl
No me canso de ver los videos del half time del Superbowl, en serio se siente tanto orgullo Colombiano estando tan lejos 🇨🇴❤️.

If someone came from another planet just as the super bowl halftime show was on, they would assume that on earth most men wear clothes and most women don't.

But at least Shakira wore sensible shoes.

Didnt watch the SuperBowl.  Hell nah.  But to defend Shakira &amp;J Lo - both amazingly talented Latinas with millions of fans - if they were blue eyed blonde Trumpsters, there wouldnt be a peep of discord.   So suck it, ya jellin Trumpster Karen types!  We love #JLo &amp; #Shakira !!!!

I personally don’t care what women wear. I hear a lot of talk about the #SuperBowl #HalftimeShow . Some saying it objectified women and some saying it was women’s empowerment.

Which is it?  

Because women’s empowerment and objectification are starting to look a lot alike. 😜
Even when Shakira was on stage with Jlo towards the end I was still more hype to see Jlo 
Both women did a phenomenal job and I’m sure the hrs they put into rehearsals paid off ! #SuperBowl #SuperBowlHalftimeShow2020

@T_Nenninger Moi non plus et d'ailleurs j'ai une bonne douzaine d'ailes et de pillones de poulet au four, des ailes post SuperBowl.
@trendchasernews The Super Bowl is over. Can we please move on
@Patriots @HeartEyes4Brady @TomBrady It was nice of Brady to let this fan in on a picture 😆😂  #GOAT #SuperBowl
Lmao...what's so family friendly about superbowl??...the drunks...the cheerleaders in half the clothing as JLo and Shakira???? https://t.co/jFaI1jYqXe
@Shefani_Gwake @popligion (2)it is 100%not my fault if the society OVERSEXULIAZED women . if a men take his shirt off at the superbowl everyone is talking nicely about his body. and when a woman moves her body (embracing her culture)thats a crime. OH COME ON., THATS FKG SEXISM. AND THAT NEED TO STOPS
@pendleton_rita @Chief_Wildcat The players number and names on the back?
I ordered the shirt with the teams and game scores on the back.
And the red shirt with Super Bowl ring on it

@IllegalCurve Backhand ?  That is like Seattle going for a pass on 1 yrd line in Super Bowl  rather than running it.

#SexyBowl  Bon! Merde, on est en 2020. Le Super Bowl se déroule en territoire américain. Les États-Unis représentent le monde évolué dans lequel les hommes et les femmes sont égaux en droit. Du sex-appeal, oui, mais faut inclure des p’tits monsieurs sexys, c’est 50% de l’humanité
It still amazes me that Whitney sang at the superbowl and it was her first take of the track. She had that much magic. Her doc on Netflix still makes me so sad and in awe.
I just wanna say a current Super Bowl champion took my playing time on our High school basketball team. Now I ain’t mad about it no mo! 😂😂😂😂 Congratz G 💪🏾😎@Lammons_1 https://t.co/XIHnyhckrS

@gmfb The Chiefs are probably going to be their own worst enemy. Little bit easier winning a super bowl when you have a 40 million-dollar quarterback playing for 1M. Once he gets paid it'll be harder to keep talent in KC

Was a great NFL season lot of good wins some tuff losses  especially my last play in the Super Bowl, however I learned a few more goood lessons in handicapping I promise myself to come back next season better then this season with all my wages...
@sheldonmsmith First Super Bowl in 50 years? I’d give them the Sea of Red title for a day lol

I wonder how President Trump is enjoying the Super Bowl celebrations from the great state of Kansas City!? #HeSaidItNotMe #Chiefs #NFL
Not gonna lie, our @Wpg_BlueBombers Grey Cup parade seemed WAAAYYYY more lit than today’s Super Bowl parade. 
Just sayin. 💙💁🏻‍♀️💛
Super happy for the city of Kansas City and it’s fans though.
Ya but Adam Levine’s Super Bowl thing was way more memeable

Most disturbing act in the Super Bowl: https://t.co/IniVhGKR8D Nobody from the audience runs onto the field. If they do, they’re given the boot.
@TheRickWilson @freddyatton trump looked really ill during the sotu and he's been messing up sentences quite a bit and slurring his speech. I doubt he survives the campaign health wise. What happened to him in that national anthem video from that Superbowl Parry? trump looked trashed.
@spiceandswift Google the Tide Super Bowl commercials and watch them in sequence. The marketing nerd in you still wants to 😋

@ShadyFansite Do you think Em would ever perform at the super bowl? I’ve heard rumors he’s denied it in the past.

Maybe his lyrics might not be ‘child friendly’ for that type of performance or maybe if Detroit hosts it?
@Chughes612 A dynasty off one super bowl in 50 years?

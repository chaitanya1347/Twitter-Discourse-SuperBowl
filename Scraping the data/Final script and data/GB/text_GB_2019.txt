@NFL @Patriots Probably the best Patriots team was the one that lost the Superbowl to the Giants. Might sound stupid but that team lost less games than any Pats teams since
Philadelphia Eagles. Super Bowl hangover? Who knows. Inconsistent absolutely. I’m not mad. Just do smart things this off season.

I love the NFL. I love the Super Bowl. 

But the fact that so many people who have no interest in the NFL the other 51 weeks of the year act as though it's the highlight of their year when in reality they have no idea what is going on, really ruins it for me.

Rant over.

Anyone else keep misreading Superbowl  LIII as Superbowl Lil ???
@Lochri69 Always watch the Superbowl! Usually not live, but figured I'd try this year haha
The Guardian is spot on:-

“For Americans,it’s the biggest sporting event of the year. For much of the rest of the world it’s an excuse to stay up past bedtime with 17 wiki tabs open to pages like “fly route” and “long snapper” trying to make sense of what’s going on.”

Ok. What your predictions y’all. Who’s going to win Super Bowl 2019.
I have a breakfast bowl, soup bowl and a goldfish bowl but never a super bowl
@NathanZegura @bakermayfield I don’t think they were close at all as Mayfields impact was profound and is now reshaping a franchise. It’s just an award for the most popular player rather than most valuable player. Mayfields going to the super bowl, Saquon Barkley is not.

Superbowl 53 tonight and frankly you're inhuman if you aren't rooting for the Rams. Can't have the Patriots tied in 6 Superbowls with the #Steelers. It just wouldn't be right.

Then we will travel, and the drinking will begin. 

And with any luck, we’ll remember to turn the game on.

It’s #SuperBowl Sunday, come on the @RamsNFL #Rams #anyonebutthepatriots
@JonnoPayton I think we also have the passion of the convert which makes the antipathy all harder to take. Doesn't help that the Superbowl is the game non-fans watch but is probably the worst to start on. Longer ad breaks, HT show and normally a bad game.
Super Bowl Sunday 🙌 #SBLIII
@JGow5 Super Bowl on your birthday! I hope you’ve got Monday off! Happy Birthday.x

@CorruptedPOD its 2 years since i got to know man, that was on a #SuperBowl night. Here we're once again, i am glad i got to know you and amazing people that has &amp; still here through it all.
PSA:

Dear my ‘veteran’ American Football friends.

Don’t get mad at that person at your #Superbowl party that asks stupid questions and makes incorrect observations, you were one of them once yourself. 

Just pat them on the head and move on.
It’s SuperBowl Sunday 🏈🏆🏟 Will not be moving far from the NFL Network all day #SuperBowlLIII #SuperBowlSunday

It' finally here #SuperBowl Sunday &amp; could Brady make it 6th title? equally the record or will those #LARams be looking for revenge that goes all the way back to 2001, when #Patriots started this amazing dynasty era. https://t.co/kjWLhQMwAx
Well it's that time of the year again, 5 hours plus of adverts to play 60 minutes of sport, yes it's superbowl Sunday a pointless game that no one outside America actually understands the concept of 🏈🏈🏈🏈🏈🏈🏈🏈🏈
@ricardo_how The Super Bowl adverts are one of the best parts!
Looking for to watching my first ever Super Bowl live at a Super Bowl Party at Hickories Smokehouse 😍

I have to say I want Rams to win this one #LARams #SuperBowl

@bglendenning don't give up on attendance game victory. I don't have any budgies, nor a ticket for the superbowl,  but I do have a particularly magnificent squirrel in my garden named after you and access to the red button #KeepTheFaith
Right. Building up to my annual #superbowl tweet.
Super Bowl Sunday! 🏈 🙌 #SuperBowl #anyonebutthepats
#superbowl53 Will be the first one in many years that I've not watched. Got to work early the following day and need to save my holiday allowance for later in the year. The thought of stopping up until 4 and seeing Brady pick up another ring doesn't really appeal. #SuperBowl

@RamsNFL Good luck in the Superbowl. Will be keeping fingers crossed. Cheering you on from 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
After managing to hardly watch much of the regular season or playoffs and not getting to a game this year, I feel a bit of a fraud on Super Bowl Sunday this year - like one of the one-game-a-year people I normally moan about...
Super bowl and Mac 'n' cheese, 2 really shit American things.

So hyped for the Super Bowl tonight man 😁
When is the very best time for me to nap in order to be in tip-top condition for Super Bowl watching later?

ADDED CONTEXT: I only had about 3 hours sleep last night.

SUPER BOWL SUNDAY😍🙌🏻🏈🏈
Superbowl and the museum owls are out. AGAIN. 🤦‍♂️
Philly cheesesteak dip, chicken parmesan sliders, and snickerdoodles all ready to pop in the oven tonight! #SuperBowl
@NinjaPotts Oh yay! It's the night where my husband is 100% up for all night wakings. (Night wakings since previous Super Bowl = 1. Maybe 2)
Are you on the way to your dream destination 🤔
#holiday #superbowl #london #camden https://t.co/1gc2cWYMCM
FACT OF THE DAY:

They call it American FOOTball because the ball is a foot long from tip to tip. 🏈

Nothing to do with kicking it with your feet.

Come on now Saints fans. Shit like the other week happens in sports. Actually wanting the Pats to win another Super Bowl is mad. Wasn't the Rams' fault the refs are blind! McVay, Goff, Gurley, Kupp, Donald &amp; co are quality, I would much rather them win over TB, BB, Gronk etc.
#SuperBowl Sunday!
Something very satisfying about a fully stocked fridge! #Superbowl! https://t.co/a6OqER10ZI

Currently eating burnt cookies and crying bc this is the first Super Bowl I’m not home for and it feels so weird and sad 😢
If you're yet to be excited for #SuperBowlSunday simply follow this technique. Rediscover the Christian worship song "Isn't He, beautiful? Beautiful, isn't He." and change the lyrics to: "Superbowl, superbowl" By the final crescendo you'll be pumped and good to go! #SuperBowlLIII
Not an American football fan but keep one eye on all Boston area sports team good luck to the @Patriots later! #SuperBowl

Not to fussed about working early tomorrow and missing Super Bowl, after how amazing last year’s was personally, even if it’s a 100 point game tonight, I’ll struggle to get excited. Roll on September! 😐
it will be interesting to see which team wins the super bowl
Can’t wait to not watch the Super Bowl.
@NatCoombs Well another season ends tonight.  This Superbowl has the makings of being a classic.  Thank you for bring the 2018/19 season.  Arguably the best sports coverage in UK at the moment.  Oh I cannot decide on a winner tonight.
Feeling like shite with a headache and the oncoming stress of being ill.  Going to bed.
Given I've got insomnia atm anyway, I think that will guarantee I'll be awake for the Superbowl later.

So in America, you can't watch the #SuperBowl for free just on "normal" TV. You have to watch either on cable (which you pay for) or via app/online. Biggest sports event in US and not on "normal" TV channel. Even in UK, it's just on for a free channel - BBC @BBCSport https://t.co/isXYzc8l27
was well disappointed with the match up after last week’s games but now it’s here actually quite looking forward to the super bowl tonight! 🏈
Oh. And we won the quiz in the legends bar.😅

Not a bad day tbh. Kebab to round it off then it's the Super bowl later.
Just need the Patriots to win and I'll be well happy

I’m not going to watch the SuperBowl. It would be 5hrs of me shouting “Where’s the ball? Can you see where the ball is? Who has the ball? Where’s the f’ing ball!”
Last season I watched my beloved @Dodgers_UK lose in the world series AND @UK_Patriots lose in the #superbowl

This season, I've already seen the @Dodgers fall at the final hurdle. Can @Patriots end my run of disappointments?
superbowl tonight💉

@GothamTVPodcast @YouTube Great top WTF moments. Great shirts you are wearing. Enjoy the #SuperBowl
Second half thoughts:
1 #SuperBowl crowning a “world champ” is comical
2 this football is world’s game
3 a privilege to watch world’s best footballers in birthplace of global beautiful game
4 sports business/media: the inclusivity you claim should be reflected in your profession https://t.co/4cVQLsNGdh

I really should have thought about having a nap in prep for the Super Bowl, snacks and coffee....work your magic
Why oh why did the @SuperBowl have to be on so late over here when I have a 6:45am start in the morning 😩
What a day. Now #superbowl #presseco prep
Thanks to Amazon's All or Nothing series I have started to enjoy the #NFL
I'm still learning, but after last season I am a bit of a @LARams_UK @RamsNFL fan. Hoping they win #SuperBowl #Rams #RamsHouse
Ahh yes the #superbowl...the one night of the year where I don't understand howAmerican football works and have no fucking clue what is going on but watch regardless 😂
Unpopular opinion... I couldn't think of anything worse than watch the #Superbowl tonight. 
What a shit sport that is!

Feel like I’m the only person who won’t be watching the Super Bowl tonight. I don’t get the infatuation, personally.
NFL grand final tonight. Up for work at 3:30 so I’ll probably catch the final innings #SuperBowl #SuperBowlLIII https://t.co/THF7n5Y2dZ
Remember watching the Super Bowl for the 1st time in 2008 while on holiday in Cancun,  thought it was complete shite, even after a dozen Coronas.   
11 years on, my thoughts haven't changed...
Why did I not book tomorrow off? No @SuperBowl for me. 😔
THREE HOURS TO GO UNTIL SUPER BOWL 🏈

Check out my preview on tonight’s game. 

One last plug, I swear. I’v been overwhelmed with the PV’s. Thanks guys 👍 https://t.co/n9KP5hLQ8U

Would anybody pick A!? If you would rather go to a super bowl live than have the Steelers win it, unfollow me. I can’t think of anything worse than actually going to a super bowl and watching us lose, let alone actually choosing to knowingly https://t.co/8GSCuZehf4
@mark__heath I agree those are awesome stats but let’s not forget Brady has won more than Montana has ever appeared in. 9 Super Bowl appearances for TB12 and the most winningest post season QB ever.
Yeeee Haaaa! It’s the Super Bowl tonight! Oh that’s right, I couldn’t be any less interested if I tried. 🇺🇸
I mean I’ll attempt to stay up and watch the super bowl but I doubt I will be able to 😂
@Ruth_Less_Lady I’m snuggled up already so I can doze but leave telly on for super bowl

Do I watch Super Bowl or go bed for a training course tomoz??
@Wrightie7 No interest for me either in terms of the actual game, although fascinated by some of the news around it. There is always such a big deal about who is doing the half time cabaret act. I much prefer the Coldstream Guards band on FA Cup Final Day! 😉 #Superbowl

I am so disinterested in Super Bowl that I don’t even have a clue which teams are playing 🤷‍♀️
Trump 2016: Tackle. Bing. Flag. Football has become soft. Football has become soft like our country has become soft.

Absolutely buzzing for the Super Bowl, should be a cracking game and end to another beltur season. Would love to see the Rams do it but can’t see past Tommy getting ring number 6. #SuperBowlSunday
Watching the Patriots lose in the Super Bowl is usually the highlight of the sporting calendar for me. Thankfully I’ve never seen them win it as I turn the telly off and go to bed if it looks likely.
Super bowl is for nonces, simple
Who’s taking the Lombardi Trophy tonight? #SuperBowl
Oh here it goes, the one day of the year were everyone who hasn't had anything to do with American football for the last 12 months suddenly "can't WAAAIIIIT for the Superbowl!!" 🤔🤨 OK hun...

Getting the urge to stay up for the Super Bowl despite knowing it’ll make tomorrow disastrous. Think I’ll drink this bottle of Meine Hopfenweisse and take the decision out of my hands.

#SuperBowlSunday then. Reminded by the other half of a weird Coors Light SuperBowl party we were at years ago when I worked for them. Girls Aloud played "live" &amp; it was at the Hippodrome. Embarrassingly empty as I remember &amp; the toilet attendants were hiding in the cubicles.
Me: mitras do you want to watch the super bowl with us?
Mitras: I don’t like football
Me: no one actually likes it we’re doing it for the food and commercials 
Max: I don’t like these vibes do I need to watch alone??
I'm going to watch the Super Bowl later. I don't understand American Football. Will this be an issue? https://t.co/vStdYhROmm

Superbowl tonight 🏈 What are you all up to this evening?
It’s also 17 years to the day that the then St. Louis Rams lost to the Patriots in Super Bowl XXXVI

How does this Rams vintage compare to the 2001 season’s Greatest Show on Turf? 

I looked at the @OptaJerry numbers to find out

Do we even need to do the Super Bowl? Brady doesn’t lose.
Who you got in the big game tonight? #SuperBowl
100% no even contemplating staying up to watch the Super Bowl it’s on far too late + long. It shall be recorded though. #SuperBowlLIII
Looking forward to the superbowl final, think it will be a good game of 2 halves. Can see it being 1-0 to either side.
Just arrived at @CampandFurnace to watch @NFL #SuperBowl @Pats_Superbowl vs @RamsNFL @SuperBowl #NFL 🏈 https://t.co/vFfDNOUpFP
Super Bowl Sunday! Snacks are sorted, beers are chilling and the bets are on! Now we wait my heart says Rams but I have a little niggle that says Pats might just do it... either way will be a good game! https://t.co/Qoi7gaT1gj

@Ninja who do you think will win the Super Bowl?
@WarrenAJB @MarcWilliams22 Think I’ll do some of the Super Bowl tonight. My worry is I do the lot and have 3 hours sleep. Also going to a baseball game during trip to New York in April. Only getting cheapest tickets, beer, hot dog and if we’re bored off we go.
Attempting to stay up for the #SuperBowl but not sure if I'll manage it after being out on the beers all day yesterday! Might go for a strategic nap now...

Been watching NFL since Channel 4 coverage in 1980s, but only just realised this year that my age at each SuperBowl is the SuperBowl #. D’oh.
This will be the first #Superbowl I will not watch in about 20 years. 

Don't care much for both teams!
One year, I will stay up and watch the SuperBowl

Philadelphia aren't in the Superbowl so there's no point.
Argh!! Wine racks doors are locked and they aren’t meant to be closing until 10! They are the keepers of Budweiser!! It’s SUPERBOWL SUNDAY! But I noticed the shop assistant go to Tesco so I am currently spying on him and waiting for him to go back so I can buy beer
@RossFootball The West Indians showed #SuperBowl ing in the Second Test against England
Ok got be up at 4am to get N to the Bus, buts also the #SuperBowl2019 so I guess I won’t be sleeping tonight, so I will apologise in advance for any incoherent tweeting tomorrow.
Really want to watch the Super Bowl but it’s a school night so there’s just no chance. Nobody needs to start a Monday on a few hours sleep 😴

Not a huge NFL fan but I hope personally the super bowl later goes down as a classic, may the best team win! @Mrstrong76 @jwoodall88
In a battle between youth &amp; experience, who will win the #SuperBowlLIII the @RamsNFL or @Patriots ? Can the #Pats win a 6th title.. super excited! Kudos to Sean McVay for being the youngest ever @SuperBowl coach too. #GoPats #LARams #SuperBowlSunday https://t.co/pPw30FKtos

Super Bowl tonight and although I love the spectacle of it it’s no sport. An hour turned into hours through trying to work out how to get a ball from one end to another. And offence and defence changes, look at rugby. Ready for hate now #SuperBowlSunday

Does the SuperBowl go to extra time and penalties if the scores are tied at the end of the game? Or do they go to a replay Wednesday week?

Hoping for a @RamsNFL win but I can see the Goat getting his 6th Super Bowl Ring unfortunately! #SuperBowl53

I just can not get over how good #LadyGaga was in this. I’ve watched it so many time. I can take you through, frame by frame how good it was. It was honestly the best #SuperBowl show. I thought that was gonna be the peak for her, then came @starisbornmovie. Lordy lord. #Shallow
@OsiUmenyiora HEY BAE 😍😍😍 #NFLLIII #SuperBowl2019
Can’t remember such a finely balanced Super Bowl. Really can’t pick a winner. Let’s hope the refs call a good game and the best team wins.

Watching #Superbowl on #BBCNFL you bring a good question if the fans of the rams are not in Atlanta who are the people in st Louis supporting and what does that say about Vegas #VegasRaiders
Not bothered by NFL Super Bowl, but the atmosphere in the stadium is something to behold. A bit like FA Cup final days of many years ago. #longwhile ago.
When you hate both teams that are playing,who do you want to win🤦‍♂️😳 #SuperBowl

Off to bed early, Gym at 6.30am, no debate. There was a time when I could roll with the #SuperBowl all night but too old now. Prediction for #SuperBowl2019 #Patriots by a small margin Bon Soir!
Watching @SuperBowl come on the @Patriots #SuperBowl53
If you're a neutral with a heart this #Superbowl just remember that Kroenke, the #LARams owner owns an extreme exotic animal hunting tv channel. He is therefore a class A c*nt.  Go #Patriots. And I say this as a Seahawks fan. But trophy hunting is evil.
Super Bowl day means a new one of,these! Been waiting for this since last year’s one! 😂 #SBLIII https://t.co/NwEwZiTkXu
I really don’t get the hype about American football and the super bowl. I’d rather watch paint dry.
So this #SuperBowl thing is basically just Rugby with helmets and big pads then.
@Samwhi @karljb I want to take the few days after off; super bowl is on my bucket list.
Yay #SuperbOwl time! #bestbird
@mickquinn1089 First #Superbowl for me! Never been interested but watching clips, highlights, then live games, I’m now interested! Happy to give it ago, sports sport, I could be a fan

The Super Bowl really is the best time of the year to witness people getting really fucking pissed off because people they don't know like something they don't like. It's wonderful.
WOOOOOOOOO!

Massively excited for the #SuperBowl and the Rams hopefully shutting down the Patriots, but watching Branden Grace fluff it at the 17th to all but end his chances of winning the #PhoenixOpen after backing him at 100-1 is a bit of a stinger.

Almost time for people to put up a snapchat of the Super Bowl on their TV even though they have no intention of actually watching it.
It's Super Bowl warm up and we are playing the Xbox. Nothing Changes. https://t.co/verh8EuETA
People don’t seem as fixated with the super bowl this year (judging by social media); maybe they’ve realised there’s only one form of egg chasing which matters https://t.co/Wj8L9rD7Zx
Watching #SuperBowl tonight is like watching #THFC v #CFC for me, I don’t want either to win! My feelings towards @RamsNFL however and the fact Kroenke is involved means I must support @Patriots tonight! #TeamBrady
Benfica beat sporting. Porto draws. And super bowl Sunday. Life is good
@nuts_about_ @SuperBowl @RamsNFL @Patriots @NFL Tough one to call. I don’t think there’ll be much in it, 5-7 points either way.
The only part of the #SuperBowl I care about is all the new film trailers
Getting the treats ready for #SuperBowl53 #nfl @SuperBowl #SuperBowlSunday @NFL https://t.co/90G0v4eo92
Hoping to watch the #SuperBowl, but after walking around London after the 10K AND having had a lovely bubble bath, it's looking very unlikely...but I hope Brady fails at everything he tries to achieve. And that can happen in my dreams if I choose to sleep...🤔 #RAMSHOUSE
It’s that time of the year, go Pats #superbowl @ Byroms House https://t.co/xtGodM7j40
Trying to stay up for the super bowl. As a huge pats fan my whole life. I don’t think I’ll make it

Fuck the Super Bowl!!!
Who cares??
Hope Weah has a good night watching the super bowl
@HKane fan boying at the #superbowl is just the cutest🙊 #lovehim
Since 1992, I've watched every Superbowl live;  now, because I have to be in Bradford at 8am for a work critical meeting, I had to cancel my holiday day, and will miss the game.

The Moral of this story is:
- Responsibility is bad
- Don't get older
- I hate this
Staying up to attempt to watch the super bowl! Come on you rams!!!
@JasonBell33 Work early tomorrow. Bed or Superbowl? Like for bed, retweet for Superbowl 👌🏈

Buzzing for super bowl!!
#superbowl Would prefer to see the Rams win but have a feeling it's the Patriots night. Gone for them with a margin of 7-12 pts. 9/2 at the bookies.
The Superbowl is absolutely shite, never understood why it’s such a big deal
Would love to stay up and watch the #SuperBowl but work 🤷🏻‍♂️

Best thing about the #SuperBowl is this stadium in Atlanta

Still baffles me how so many people watch NFL. Take away the showbiz and media circus that follows the Super Bowl, it’s an absolutely abysmal sport. Ball never in play, about 50 people on each team, majority of the team requires little skill besides being big and fast. Rubbish 💩
@CorruptedPOD just wishing you &amp; your #Patriots all the best ahead of kick off. Now go smash those #LARams and reclaim your crown once again. #superbowl #SuperBowlSunday #SBLIII

I enjoy the #SuperBowl but LOL that guys name is Gurley.
It just sounds like the Tom Brady show, yes he's a great player but there are other players on the field #SuperBowl
@SaraBeverley The main reason I'm watching the Superbowl. They just dropped Captain Marvel footage as well
Intense start. Rams defense looking solid. #SuperBowl #SBLIII
I won’t pretend to know what’s happening, but good god this is slow. They’ve only actually played the game for about 1 minute. #SuperBowl2019
Actually have such a distaste for the Patriots and I honestly don't know why 😂 #SuperBowl
Love the #superbowl https://t.co/eyFzdqRAwe
Me watching the super bowl: HIDE THE BALL! RUN! WHAT'S HAPPENING??
Fair play to Sky getting @IanWright0, @RobbieSavage8, @Paul_Gascoigne8 for the #SuperBowl great line up https://t.co/oI4Zlssj9D
As bad as this is going for New England, Rams' offense has been inexistent and their defense periodically leaves big gaps.. let your foot off the Pats' neck one second and you'll lose this game
#SuperBowl #NEvsLAR
#SuperBowl is so slow. What are all these time outs about?

Missed field goal there in the Super Bowl but it’s a penalty to the rangers anyway 😬
Despite delighting in some of the pundits, @reenieroulade taking a dim view of the action #SuperBowl
Don’t see how American Football can be called football when it’s mainly played with your hands😂 #SuperBowl2019 #LARams #Patriots
FG attempt but it’s..... #SuperBowl https://t.co/jt1rPjqb3Z
Wow now a Captain Marvel drop!!! #SuperBowl
Between that wild missed throw from Brady &amp; that field goal, the Pats need to learn Rule 96 #SuperBowl #Hercules https://t.co/mK8cUgiLe9
Jim Nantz, just before a FG attempt: "No-one has missed a FG in this stadium this season"...
No guesses what happens next! Incredible! #SuperBowl #SBLIII #NFL #NFLUK #CommentatorsCurse
Slightly amused by how budget the BBC #SuperBowl studio is. Like four IT consultants at a trade show.
Commentators curse much? #SuperBowl
#SuperBowl commentators scud yet again😬@CBSSports @BBCSport
That kick going wide is one of my favourite Super Bowl moments ever. #SuperBowlLIII #NoOneLikesThePatriots
#SuperBowl “Not a missed field goal in this stadium” JINX ... missed field goal 😂😂😂
Commentators curse strikes again. And Tony Romo is psychic #SuperBowl #bbcsuperbowl
The NE field goal attempt is NO GOOD! 0-0 #SuperBowl
I can’t be the only person watching this thinking how is this even a sport #SuperBowl2019
@BrianMcleish @JTweedie @davethewingnut @OsiUmenyiora This has been the year that the Kicker position collapsed...😲 seriously, someone should be checking what they are all being fed this season...#SuperBowl

That’s amazing! Loving that shank right there.  #SuperBowl

Super bowl timeeeee with my amazing mum! Can you tell I’m a big patriots fan ( I’m aware they are universally hated &amp; they deffo have their flaws but I can’t help but love them).

Ffs #SBLlll #SuperBowl
I gave up on trying to get excited by (or even understand) the #SuperBowl several years ago. They bill it as 'The Greatest Show On Earth' because the actual gameplay is usually about as gripping as watching compost, so they have to hype up all the tangential excitement instead.
Just wait till the yanks see the checkatrade final on netflix, they will say fuck the superbowl! #SAFC
@DarrenOnRecord I’ve refused to watch the super bowl since my 22nd birthday where I sat up drinking all night and threw up on my bedroom floor. Horrible times.
First time watching the Super Bowl! I have no idea what’s going on but it is exciting!! #bbcnfl
American tv ads are so dramatic #superbowl #doritos
Just don't get this super bowl shit I'm off to bed 😴😴 #bbcnfl
C'mon #TB12 #Superbowl #GOAT 🐐 c'mon Bill get that defense bang on it. @patriots
London doesn’t broadcast the Super Bowl commercials so basically I’m 0% invested in this game
Bit controversial however, the super bowl is boring! Yes, boring. I m off to bed.
I’ve got a Brit Super Bowl announcer watching g here on the BBC. Makes it all sound so much more polite and intelligent #Super Bowl
When you see U.S. fans talking about the ads but here in the UK on BBC we have no ads at all! #SuperBowl #nfluk @nfluk https://t.co/taqLQ5IOVr
ALWAYS starts slow, he's terrible 1st quarter every time, then comes off as MVP, a hero and all the rest, very slow starter, he'll get going..... #SuperBowl #SuperBowl53 https://t.co/lI3vqQeNVO

If the Patriots don’t win this year, I won’t be happy #SuperBowl
Watching the #Superbowl from Scotland and trying to figure out how the game works... it kinda looks like armoured rugby but they keep stopping the game every few seconds? I'm genuinely confused!
Here we go. Everyone has the shitey super bowl on despite never watching a game of American football in their life...🤦🏻‍♂️

Good show everyone, hit the showers

Big fan of the ref’s being mic’d up to the speakers for the #Superbowl 😂 Any chance we can get Mike Dean mic’d up in the Premier League. I would love to hear some of his reactions 😂
That is some stadium in Atlanta, GA that is hosting the super bowl tonight.
There’s 1 super shit call by the refs #SuperBowl2019
Can feel a pick 6 in the game #Superbowl
For such a massive occasion, the atmosphere at the Super Bowl is pants, heard a louder crowd at St Mirren 😳

@SidneyRodwell SuperBowl is Lots of guys wearing crash helmets and duvets running around barging each other. It's really "It's a knockout" isn't it? When do the Italians join in? Is Eddie Waring commentating? Jeuxsansafrontieres
I would rather watch paint dry than American football. #SuperBowl
Sat watching SUPER BOWL 53 😴😴😴.couple of questions??  1. Why is it called American FOOTBALL!! they use there hands not there feet🤔 2... why even call it a football the ball not even round bloody thing is egg shaped.
11:30pm, just got home (work dinner), my eldest son switch the TV to the Super Bowl so I thought I’d watch it. 20 minutes in, probably no more than a minute of actual play, lots of standing around, endless replays and a halftime break (except it’s not halftime). I’m going to bed!
Super Bowl Sundays are nowhere near as fun when you have work at 7am😢
I’m behind the team that look like upside down minions. #goupsidedownminions #SuperBowl https://t.co/GiXyGrkVgn
If they’re gonna call that in the Super Bowl we may as well all go home
For some reason, @LJHeronHBFS has put the #SuperBowl on. I have no idea what is happening, so I just keep shouting "laces out" at random intervals in the hope I'll be right at some point.

Here we go, back to the #SuperBowl bullshit for the Pats. #Cheats
Super Bowl 🏟 = Build Up... Build Up ... Build Up... Kick off. Each team celebrates every interception and tackle like they have won it followed by 5 minutes adverts and 10 minutes analysis!  Repeat for 4 hours. 
1 team wins! The end.
Anyone else only watching the #SUPERBOWL  just to know when to turn on #HalftimeHeat  🤔 #JDalpha @WWENXT https://t.co/ZO5qdRTAL7

Don’t have a clue what’s going on 😂 This is my fifth year watching the #Superbowl and still haven’t picked it up 😂 but I feel like I’m missing out if I don’t watch it 🤷🏻‍♂️

Right, I’ve watched 5 minutes of of the Super Bowl; Rugby League flows better than this (and that’s saying something)
and as a game Rugby Union is far superior......... NFL = tackle, stop, tackle, stop🙄🙄🙄
What a start to the Super Bowl! Looked like New England where going to run their way into the end zone, first passing play = interception. Then New England’s defence came out to play and forced a three and out. LA need to stop the run and quick.
Super Bowl: Patriots vs. Rams #SBLIII https://t.co/PLlBpHIsOd

@georgiebingham are you going to sit on the fence or call the Super Bowl tonight ?
Got distant relatives who are Patriots fans so I'm going for them. Up the #Patriots #SuperBowl

Robey-Coleman’s a twat, pass it on #SBLlll #SuperBowl
Early pick for the Rams. Booooom #SuperBowl2019
Robey-Coleman making a big play in the Super Bowl just to stick another dagger in the heart of Saints fans
So if anyone takes me on a date to Mercedes Benz stadium, you might get a proposal. #SuperbOwl 🦉💍
YES!! INTERCEPTION!!! CMON RAMS!!! #SuperBowl
British people pretending to like the super bowl is a sort of cultural appropriation. A bit like celebrating st Patrick's day.
Whoaaaaaaa Go Rams #SuperBowl
Right I am out. Enjoy the #superbowl everyone. Will be back after I’ve watch it tomorrow evening #nfl #nfluk
@TroupyTRFC #SuperBowl you had a go of this Texan lager? https://t.co/Frgz3n4anh

Somehow ended up watching the Super Bowl. Hope I end up wrong but fuck me this is slow init?! Replay after every throw. 🙄
Giving the Patriots first dibs is a mistake. #SuperBowl
I always struggle around the super bowl because this is the time of year I had to go to “treatment” 8 years ago. No matter how far away I move or how many minutes pass it still hurts and I’m still not ok. So. SOS?
"That's the problem with The New England Patriots they always try and walk it in."

Wish I understood what was happening in the #SuperBowl
@CelticFC @SuperBowl @ussoccer_mnt @RamsNFL @Patriots @NFL @CBS Up the Ra troops. Never mind that pish, get @wolfetones back recording at Paradise. 💚
All we really want to see is Suh/Donald get a clear shot at Brady, is that too much to ask? #SuperBowl⁠ ⁠
So #AvengersEndgame teaser before the kickoff of the #SuperBowl does this mean a full trailer at the end of the game 🤷.
Watching #SuperBowl #GoRams
Super bowl LIII is underway! C’mon the  @RamsNFL can’t have those patriots winning again!
Have no idea what's going on but finally seeing what all the fuss is about #SuperBowl
Super Bowl Sunday!! 🏆🏈
Watching the #superbowl #GoPats #TomBrady
Crying buckets at #LesMisérables @BBCOne Now it’s the #SuperBowl. Trying to compose myself.
"Super Bowl: Patriots vs. Rams" #SBLIII https://t.co/C0xS0PuWCD
Right!! Shower done ready to watch the #Superbowl ain't gotta go bed too early tonight for work so I am gonna try and stay up as long as possible!! #bbcnfl
LET’S GO @Patriots!!!! #SuperBowl
Well it’s that time of year again, the time when I have to choose between #SuperBowl and sleep! I may just watch a little on #bbcnfl... 😏 Come on the Rams!!! #SuperBowlLIII
Superbowl at the Hard Rock Cafe come on RAMs!! #hardrockcafeglasgow https://t.co/AsCp96chBB

I don't care who knows it. I'm cheering for the Old Guy that nobody likes, #TomFuckingBrady. Go @Patriots! #SuperBowl
Watch the Super Bowl stream from CBS to see the new film trailers, Avengers clip just been on 😳😳👍
Lets go patriots #SuperBowl
Sean McVay with a class pre-match interview. Bill Belichick on the other hand... #BBCNFL #SuperBowl https://t.co/H3DEWkTZIH
Super Bowl LIII #gopats
My brother convinced that Kroenke's Rams winning the Super Bowl will have the same effect it did with Liverpools owners when they won theirs...

...I disagree, Kroenke is toxic and the only thing I want to see now is his golden team fail in achieving his dream #SuperBowl #SBLIII
Wow @MsGladysKnight absolutely amazing!   Chloe&amp;Halle fabulous   #SuperBowlLlll  #SuperBowl2019 #chloeandHalle #NFLUK #NFL
Watching the super bowl 🏟 still no idea how they play it 😂😂🤦🏻‍♀️
No point watching the superbowl for at least the first half an hour.. because they kick off.. then some fella catches it.. gets tackled and then they have a break.
@St12345654 @TaylorMod I’ve still got the scars from Super Bowl 52. 🥴🐝
As #SuperBowl kicks off, the major Jewish connections to tonight's historic game is #Patriots chief executive Robert Kraft.

#SuperBowl Prediction 
#Patriots 31-28 #Rams #NFL
No work tomorrow, all set for the greatest show on earth with my carrot sticks, houmous &amp; wheatgrass (seriously). Over to @tonyromo #SuperBowl⁠ ⁠ #sXe
Let’s go #SuperBowl2019
And we're off!! #SuperBowl
Game on! #SuperBowl
Interesting half, should suit the Pats more now that they’ve weathered the storm of the Rams being riled up at getting to a Super Bowl and now the Pats can come out second half and run riot
Will never understand how 60 minutes of play can take this long 😴 and yet here I am watching it 🤷‍♂️ #SuperBowl
This Super Bowl is trash
That 1st half #Superbowl https://t.co/KaFcg2Sh9m
Great insight by the @BBCSport #SuperBowl commentator @OsiUnenyiora as to the value &amp; contribution of parental support and innovation to the early development of athletes.
Would rather watch womens football rather than this shit, time for bed. #SuperBowl
That’ll do me 😴😴 #SuperBowl
#TB12 Tom needs to trust it more. Should be 12-0 up. Julian has been gr8. Let's go #Patriots C'mon Tom these 30 mins count for so much to you. #DoYourJob #Superbowl
#NFL #SuperBowl 
Dull. Defensive. Dozing. 💤
Like my defensive football 🙂 Every point matters.... #SuperBowl2019
Wish I had slept through the first half #SuperBowl not a single  #Touchdown good job they've got #PepsiHalftime #Maroon5 to get make back alive @BBCSport
Lowest scoring Super Bowl at half time since Super Bowl 9... madness
La defensa de los #Patriots dominando esta #Superbowl.  3 arriba los de New England #GoPats
I...just...can’t..stay...up... I’ll regret it when this turns into the most scintillating match of all time. But 😴😴 look forward to the spoilers in the morning! #SuperBowlLlll #SuperBowl2019
Could be the worst half of any sport I have ever seen that #SuperBowl
This is shit. #Superbowl
Let me know when Maroon 5 have finished, not interested #SuperBowl
Jared goff needs to settle... Looks like a rabbit in headlights.
Come on Rams!!! 🐏 🏈 🏈 #LARams #superbowl
Bring Back SuperBowl LII #SuperBowl #SBLIII
DEFENCE....SuperBowl. @billburr ..... this is what YOU wanted Billy....... awful to watch
Half Time in the #SuperBowl

Safe to say that the Defence’s are on top! 

@Patriots lead 3-0.

#GoPats
I see Brady gave Gronk his catching hand haha #gorams #bbcnfl #superbowl
So my thoughts on the first half of the Super Bowl? https://t.co/P2C6KP3TbX
Two first downs for the Rams is abysmal. #SuperBowl
Goff is hopelessly out of his depth here #SuperBowl
Worst first half in super bowl history #superbowl
Fitting in a season where the NFL has all been about offense, the #SuperBowl is about Patriots fans crying
My god Goff is having a terrible terrible day 😱
And Brady just can't get his head around Wade Phillips' scheme, I haven't seen this from Brady since the good old New England-Denver days 

#SuperBowl #NEvsLAR
The second lowest scoring #SuperBowl of all time - says it all really. Right I really am outta here.
The lowest scoring Super Bowl, 14-7 https://t.co/7pnIh6xfYb well on track to beat that but a lot can change.
Defense showing up and making Brady’s life a nightmare, tough game, nerve racking #SBLlll #SuperBowl2019
If anyone is doing a shot for each incomplete pass, they are currently getting rushed to the emergency room. #SuperBowl2019

@RBaroff427 Maybe we should be doing this the other way round. Get the super bowl to finish nice and early for the Waste Management to take centre stage!
“Taken down by High Tower!!!”

Police Academy 25 confirmed during #SuperBowl
Gronkowski is surely the only athlete ever to compete in both the Belmont Stakes AND the #SuperBowl
Nearly half time in the game and with 1AM fast approaching i still haven't a scooby as to how a game that lasts 60 minutes can take 4 hours?? Anyway time for another 🍺 #NFL #SuperBowl #SuperBowlLlll https://t.co/XGHBxmvGO1 https://t.co/0g9oKUfaAP
Well, so far, this has been wank. 😴 #SuperBowl #SBLIII
Goff needs to get into the game mind. #SuperBowl #SBLIII
Hope they do the Spongebob song #Superbowl
#SuperBowl #LARams #NewEnglandPatriots https://t.co/eQdMGUkF2c
Could do with another TD before half time here. More offensive play needed. #SuperBowl #Patriots
Not the greatest game #SuperBowl2019 #SBLIII eyes can’t take anymore time for some 💤
Terrible decision #Pats #SuperBowl
@LegallyBOD I saw a betting post earlier saying there had never been a Super Bowl without a touchdown, and offering good odds to go for that! I was so close but though it’s never happen. You seem to be a much better better than me! Anything on this?
Watching the #SuperBowl. I think I’ll stick to rugby.
Big stop that. #SuperBowl #SBLIII
@mitchellvii This is as close as we to to the Super Bowl in scotland 😆🤣 https://t.co/CMkNRyPzNT
MAROON 5 are performing the half time show at the #SuperBowl ...... why? Honestly how is this happening in 2019?
Omg omg omg The Twilight Zone tease. The SuperBowl promos are very on brand for me https://t.co/T8t6BhGqQZ
@desmondclee2 A bit like the Patriots fans at the Super Bowl 🤣🤣
@Edelman11 has gained more yards in this half than the whole entire @RamsNFL offence. Yet it’s still only a three point game. How? #SuperBowl
Struggling to think of a worse Super Bowl first half in "my" era of watching (37 in 2003 was my first). Even the games that were blowouts had some entertainment value. #SuperBowl #SBLIII #NFL #NFLUK
In a very defensive Super Bowl I miss watching the commercials! No commercials on #BBCNFL #SBLlll
4 years of @JasonBell33 &amp; @OsiUmenyiora has got me appreciating defence. What does Goff need to do to get more of a grip on the game? #bbcnfl #SuperBowl
The new Endgame trailer teases some returning characters...

https://t.co/vZFNvaaQGF
So... this Super Bowl thing is fun. On the plus side Maroon5 are up soon... https://t.co/Lp3IMxckNl
The Super Bowl is a load of shite
Jose Mourinho Superbowl... no one scoring from open play #SuperBowl
This has got to be the worst half of a #SuperBowl ever 😂😂
#SUPERBOWL Too many men on the field ? Can't they fucking count 😂
@Chatterbox5200 You're watching the #SuperBowl as well then Phil hey lol I'm watching for the 1st time, seeing as I am currently inbetween jobs, so I've not got to get up for work in the morning, it does have it's benefits 😜Mind you,I have zero idea what is going on! #NewEnglandPatriots #BBCNFL

#bbcsuperbowl is there prize money for the Superbowl?
@JewJuBeee Are you streaming later or watching Super Bowl? If streaming what game you streaming? I missed the Planet Coaster stream.
Wtf has Gareth Southgate got to do with the Super Bowl? Fuck off England.
Would NFL ever consider having the Super Bowl in the UK? #BBCNFL

Apparently Maroon 5 performing the half time show is the biggest music moment of the year......... is it tho?really? It’s Maroon 5?!? #SuperBowl2019 #SuperBowl
Super Bowl? How about these other two word sentences...? 

SUNDAY NIGHT
MONDAY MORNING
I WORK
MAROON 5?
I SLEEP
IM EUROPEAN
NO BOWLING
NOT SUPER
GOOD NIGHT

#SuperBowl
The difference in terms of quality will be Brady v Goff. Which means Patriots will win. #SuperBowl
@PerthshireMags The 1966 season was the first superbowl, so it's OK for the BBC to mention it.
Anyone want to try covering Edelman? Anyone? #LARams #SuperBowl https://t.co/jvMsa2d5he
I see one of the #SuperBowl half time acts is named after my penis.

I'm looking forward to seeing Travis in action on the big stage.
@SuperBowl There seems to be a lot of empty seats at the Falcons stadium! Is that because ticket prices are too high or lack of interest from fans? George Thompson
Atlanta 📍 Where I’d like to be tonight, and not for the Super Bowl.
Triple cover Edelman already #SuperBowl
Just give it Edelman #SuperBowl
@BrianMcleish @davethewingnut @JTweedie So far Edelman for MVP, brilliant performance #SuperBowl
Real battle of attrition in the #SuperBowl. Can only see the #Rams breaking first given the time the defence has been on the field.
Well the super bowl bores the shit out of me, had to turn it off so yes @Colinj46 you were right
Half time snacks #superbowl @ Watlington, Norfolk https://t.co/3Y6mFi7Gnm
Just keep throwing to Edelman please... #SuperBowl
Rams are getting schooled at the moment... #SuperBowl
Romo's commentary is the highlight of an entertaining first half #bbcnfl #BBCSport #nfl #SuperBowl #Pats #RamsHouse #Patriots
This Superbowl is boring
And that’s me done...night #SuperBowl2019 🙈
Edelman's superbowl so far #SBLIII
@Scotpatsfan It's weird mate because I really want to enjoy it hence the reason I still watch, I've watched a few games outside the super bowl and still can't love it, it's like either something is missing or something needs changed, 
Just an opinion of a crabbit Scotsman lol.
Any chance you could stop Edelman? #SuperBowl
Strange #SuperBowl so far!!!
Is this the shittest super bowl so far or what #borefest

Proper game of chess, excellent #SuperBowl
Van Noy was so close to blasting Goff full force! He looks like a deer in headlights right now, same as against the Saints 👀 you better wake up before it's too late and turns into the Lamar Jackson playoff game vs. Chargers

#SuperBowl #NEvsLAR
How many yards has Goff actually got so far? I feel like the Rams have barely moved the ball. #SuperBowl
#bbcnfl thought @HKane was injured and having a week in the #Bahamas , just seen a photo of him @NFL @SuperBowl supporting @Patriots I’m a Spurs fan but also a #Rams supporter!
Lenny Wood
Seems to be a good number of empty seats at #SuperBowl
Lack of experience when it matters from Goff. #SuperBowl
A mulher quando está assistindo Super Bowl e comendo M&amp;m’s não quer guerra com ninguém! 🏈🍫
Tight game too close to call.Rams defence spent a lot of time on.the field.#SuperBowl
There was only one punt in Super Bowl LII. This year there have been 7 in the first half. #SuperBowl #SBLIII
@ESPNStatsInfo what's the record for the most punts in a superbowl?
Super Bowl is the perfect opportunity for people who don’t follow the game or rules to feel part of a big social movement.  Brady is good right?
Can we get a TD please? Thanks. #SuperBowl
Great D-fence #Pats #SuperBowl
Win the superbowl &amp; drive off in hyundai 🕺🏼

Being a junior doctor has its perks. Both for F1 and F2, I’ve been on a night shift for the Super Bowl!
Trying to watching the SuperBowl and get right into it. Cheering away like nobody’s business. YAS cmon the patriots. 

Also me: https://t.co/ffheOv8cF6
Why have we seen so little of Todd Gurley so far?! #bbcnfl #SuperBowl
Stop. Start. Stop. Start. Stop. Start. Fucking Gemma Collins could go on for longer than these teams #SuperBowl
#bbcnfl enjoying my first super bowl having recently got a loose grasp of the rules. I’m thinking it’s a bit like golf, no matter how long you play you never know all the rules
Come on the Rams 🙏#SuperBowl2019
This years Super Bowl is so different from last years

I am just waiting for the #SuperBowl half time show and also to see the ad from @MrBeastYT for @pewdiepie . That’s all, I like “football” 🏈 (hand egg) but I prefer the real FOOTBALL ⚽️ . Also #SubscribetoPewdiepie #Sub2Pewdiepie  #M53 #NFL #Maroon5 #Atlanta
@herbie_belfast @SkyUK Seems the @SkyUK box couldn’t cope with the national anthem excitement. I switched off, turned it back on and it’s back in the game. 

Thanks to the @BBCiPlayer for being a gap filler! Am #SuperBowl
@MatthewLumby Better than the abomination planned!  #SuperBowl
#bbcnfl hey guys great show as always. We’ve travelled to Scotland to watch Superbowl in Craobh Haven. We’d love a shout-out from you guys to Stef, Grizz, Jode, Sam n Ollie if ya get chance. Respect 👍🏻
I think I get it now. 

The purpose of all these #Superbowl parties is to have enough diversions to keep people awake until the half time show ;) #bbcnfl #SBLIII
Qui fait la mi-temps du #SuperBowl cette année ?
@bigdaisylove Nice man. I'm good dude. Working away as usual. Watching the Superbowl too. I take the next day off work every year to watch it
Superbowl is shite, pass it on
Really typical Superbowl start by New England! Not really sure if we should warn New England that Rams will get started at some point, or whether warn the Rams that Brady will end up lighting you up in the 4th anyway so you should really start getting points

#SuperBowl #NEvsLAR
Yup. I don’t understand American Football. #Superbowl #bbcnfl
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump how are you enjoying the #SuperBowl this year.

#SuperBowl more cups o’tea? #NotRugby
I've watched the #SuperBowl for the last 5-6 years....I have no idea why,
The Sport has far to many stoppages which effects atmosphere severely, no flow, rules are unfathomable for the casual viewer.....and yet, I'm still watching.
#Conspiracy #SuperBowlSunday
There’s not much happening offensively but the Patriots are on top so far. Rams defense has had to do a ton of work! #SuperBowl
I could not agree with this more. #SuperBowl https://t.co/v6fkSPxTBv

As a neutral, I’m loving how tight this #SuperBowl is. And Tony Romo’s commentary is excellent. #bbcnfl
If you’re a fan of punting you’re in heaven right now #superbowl
It’s the Sloppy Bowl so far. Real messy, undisciplined play from both teams on both sides #SuperBowl
Not a catch, but already wasted those 2 timeouts so Belichick wasn't going to risk it... Reflect on those two early timeouts though? 👀

#SuperBowl #NEvsLAR
Yes @Patriots 3-0 #EverythingWeGot #SuperBowl
@BBCNews @BBCBreakfast @mrdanwalker Please tell me why BBC can show Super Bowl and not England 6 Nations??? So😡Where is the B in bbc?????
Love Tony Romo comms. Best thing he did was retire (😉). @SkySportsNFL 🏈 #SuperBowl @CBS

This might already have won the Super Bowl https://t.co/SRmpGkpR2y
Love that Southgate is at the super bowl looking to apply some of the NFL ways of approaching professional sport to apply it to the England team. That’s thinking outside the box that’s why he’s the man for England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 #BBCNFL

Watching as much of the #SuperBowl53 before going to sleep. #SuperBowl might have to catch it tomorrow. #GoPats https://t.co/2wuvdYc0o0
This is either a really good or really boring Super Bowl so far... I’ve no idea #SuperBowlLIII
The nfl highlight show is better than the super bowl
The rams offensive need to get going .. because there D not going keep pulling off stops for much longer #SuperBowl
I’m just gonna put it out there, because it makes true-er and tangible. Don’t care about many awards I’ve won, or cool clients I’ve worked so far, one day I’ll create a #superbowl ad . There, said it. Now stars...align!! And Fred, work your ass off! #SuperBowl53 #SuperBowlSunday

The fuck is the appeal of the superbowl? Pundits spending 48 minutes talking about the 12 seconds of play that's happened. Rinse and repeat.
It’s all defensive at the moment at the Super Bowl. It’s bound to kick off when I fall asleep #SuperBowlSunday @RamsNFL @NFLGirlUK

Super Bowl Fifty Three (and out) #SuperBowl
I’m in a bar, they’re playing the Superbowl. We’ve made a huge mistake!
College has ruined sporting events for me cause this Super Bowl and the two Six Nations games I’ve watched have me only thinking of the logistics of all these cameras and the utter stress of the vision mixer(s) and director(s) who have to try and coordinate this shit.
Gareth Southgate should have pulled a Rick Rude and shaved his beard between appearing on the BBC and SKY SuperBowl coverage. #SuperBowl
Watched a quarter of the Super Bowl, really don’t understand it 🙄🙄🙄
If the Rams don’t find a way to stop Edelman, they aren’t gonna hang with the Pats. Surprised there’s no score so far, but you feel the Pats aren’t far from breaking this open. #SuperBowl
Loves a #Turnover, Apple, Rhubarb - you name it, i loves it #Superbowl
Edelman MVP so far #SuperBowl
That stadium at the #Superbowl is something else.
Watching #SuperBowl2019 and for me, there is no contest between #bbcsuperbowl @BBCSport and #SkySports @SkySports 

@BBCSport win it hands down
So here in the UK the @BBC have decided to have @GarethSouthgate as one of the panellists for their #SuperBowl coverage. 🏈⚽️ #football https://t.co/PwMhT7jhHP
Harry Kane jets off to watch the the Super Bowl as he continues his recovery from injury https://t.co/QSJdiXdBTY https://t.co/4i6wSbnOmB
@GarethSouthgate not in a waistcoat - vest tonight? #bbcnfl #superbowl
I honestly don’t know what’s more cringe, American football chants or English football fans following the super bowl and posting shit like let’s go Patriots, give your head a wobble duck😷😷😷
I had both teams to score every quarter...1st bet bust 😓 #NFL #SuperBowl #SuperBowlLIII
I must be a curse on all successful sportsmen... Currently watching Tom Brady and he looks crap. He looked crap when I last stayed up in 2012. He's meant to be half decent? I'm off to sleep. #superbowl
Super Bowl on TV, more breaks and panel chat than on field action 😴 #SuperBowlSunday
Hey I know the super bowl is on, but it’s also my bday (in London) and no one has said anything #rude
@DmcDT Joxer goes to the Super Bowl... ha
Love the super bowl.   Don’t get why the bbc now feel that they have to speak to Southgate etc
If the rumours are true then David moyes is looking at getting into nfl management ffs #youhearditherefirst #SuperBowl
Trying to watch the super bowl and mark fuckin chapman wants to talk to Gareth Southgate #fuckoff 🏈🏈🏈
Gareth Southgate in the house 🏈 #SuperBowl https://t.co/80DmNFmHoy
Gareth Southgate is a national treasure #SuperBowl
@1kevincampbell This Super Bowl better liven up 😩😩😩
If that’s the only GoT teaser we’re getting this Super Bowl I’ll be mad
I should be in bed but #SuperBowl

So. Many. Stats. ❤️ https://t.co/M1jwd8BZ75
This always happens when I back both teams to score #SBLlll #SuperBowl2019
Superbowl is allowed to start now. https://t.co/7f6tMZdL9M
Another year watching the superbowl, another year not having a clue what’s going on
They called Gareth Southgate for this 😂😂 #SuperBowl2019
Right, I really have tried to enjoy and understand the Super Bowl, but to no avail. I really must have a missing link in my brain. Just can’t see anything that excites me at all. Rather watch Stoke v WBA on a cold, rainy winters night.
The beautiful game wins.
Off to bed ⚽️👍🏈👎
Another 0-0 1st qtr in @Patriots SuperBowl! A lot of strange plays but hopefully tiring out the defence #GoPats
#SuperBowl ready #SBLIII 🏈 https://t.co/pTOhJmRtY5
This Superbowl needed Mahomes
#NFL Why isn’t the Superbowl played on a Saturday like our Cup Cup final ? My eyeballs are always hanging out on a Monday morning !! Steve Kirk from Oxted, Surrey
I do not like Jared Goff’s hat #SuperBowl
@muse playing at the #SuperBowl
Come on Patriots My 10 year old have school in the morning we are watching in England  #SuperBowl
All over Gareth Southgate being a makeshift pundit for #Superbowl
@bbcnfl loving #SuperBowl2019 great to see @GarethSouthgate  are you bringing @rioferdy5 on too ?  😀😀
@hen10freeman Super Bowl nerves!
Stopped watching the super bowl so I could get into bed and read about it on here instead.

Just screaming DEAD at sacks and big tackles in Super Bowl @HeyGorman
Ffs Gareth Southgate in the commentary box for bbc at the Super Bowl 🤦‍♂️
#SuperBowl #LARams #Patriots https://t.co/vhukdB7Hk2
Let's Go @RamsNFL 🐏🏈🙌🏻 #SuperBowl
#BBCNFL turn to page 164 of programme. Could this be the lowest score in a superbowl since VII
2nd full year of watching American Football, probably the 5th #SuperBowl I've watched. My boys @OsiUmenyiora &amp; @JasonBell33 keeping me going. Enjoying this one so far. Need another beer 😅 #bbcnfl
2nd quarter LET’S GO  #GoPats #SuperBowl
I’m enjoying watching #Superbowl on #bbcnfl. I’m not even missing the commercials. Will be cool to see Baker Mayfield and the Browns playing in this game next year.
If the Rams were playing Pointless, they'd be walking off with a grand #bbcnfl #SuperBowl
I’m stunned, two consecutive first downs #SuperBowl https://t.co/uQIM8xSqpH
Oh, hello... this smacks of a game... #SuperBowl
@BBCSport @OsiUmenyiora Apart from defencive strategies from both teams has to be "Pencil Neck Blocker" #SBLIII #SuperBowl #bbcnfl
Julian Edelman has been the real MVP of this game, he's give it his all, missed on catch during the whole game, done more yards then all of them put together. In Edelman we trust. #gopats #SBLIII #SuperBowl
2am. 3. Nil. 3. Nil. #SBLIII #SuperBowl https://t.co/Kv0KOX59kh
A game made of punts. This is getting boring, c’mon guys.#superbowl #SBLIII
This superbowl is making me thinking about  bringing my marking back out.....love a bit of Maroon 5 tho 😍
#BBCNFL Ben Roethlisberger didn’t play well in his first SuperBowl. Goff just needs to get into a rhythm with some mid range competitions.
#watching im watching my 1st ever Super Bowl: Patriots hold a slight halftime lead over the Rams #SBLIII https://t.co/WiPZWV3Q4I
Rams punter for MVP

Viendo la super bowl con los amigos americanos de jajas
@beckynz Its so exciting even with just the 3 points my heart is racing. 

#superbowl #TomBrady 

I see points coming in #Atlanta
What are the chances #SuperBowl is won on a Johnny Hekker touchdown?
Choose to watch super bowl rather than play @FortniteGame what a mistake #bored #anyonebutthepats #SuperBowlLIII
@_infinitejest Just got a feeling Rams gameplan has been to keep it tight and scores low, and the Goffs gonna option the shoulder in 4th Q with huge TD pass to steal it. #SuperBowl2019
No so #SuperBowl #SBLIII https://t.co/ENEPifShuf
Great defensive game by both teams so far. Somethings got to give! #SuperBowl
Dolphins won the lowest scoring game in Super Bowl history (14-7). The fooking Patriots are going to take that record from us as well aren’t they
@SuperBowl Spectacular
As a Ravens fan, I couldn’t have asked for a better Super Bowl #defense
Considering how shit they’ve been offensively, the Rams are totally still in this. #SuperBowl
Significantly better with no audio &amp; in time lapse https://t.co/gEr2pNMlLN
Me whenever something other than a punt happens  #SuperBowl https://t.co/G5EnV1fsf2
If you had said we'd be only three points behind at this stage I would have taken it. #RAMSHOUSE #SuperBowl
Rams need a big drive now! #SuperBowl
Has a punter ever won Superbowl MVP?
Fascinating game, you can feel a game winning type of play coming. #SuperBowl
I feel a touchdown brewing #SuperBowl
Man this is quite a boring game. Yes they're doing some good defensive play and all. But there needs to be some touchdowns.... #SuperBowl #SuperBowl53 #bbcnfl #SBLIII
All I'm saying is that in England 3-0 is an amazing result. #SuperBowl
Peters @RamsNFL is beating Hogan @Patriots everytime #SBLIII #SuperBowl
In Edelman we trust. #gopats #SuperBowl #SBLIII
Worst #SuperBowl in history ?
Have i decided to watch the super bowl game the one time it’s been fucking dead
Struggling to stay awake...... what a shite game. Highlight, longest punt in SB history. #SuperBowl2019
Jared Goff has chocked so much so far. 8 punts is ridiculous #SuperBowl
The longest punt in #SuperBowl history....what a game!!! 🙄

The #patriots can have all the first downs and yards they want. Still only have 3 points to show for it. #SBLIII #SuperBowl
Missed the Superbowl last year and I feel like I'm being punished for it. 3-0 game in the 3rd Quarter #WhereThemTouchdownsAt
Exclusive insight into Jared Goff’s thought process #SuperBowl #BBCNFL #LARams https://t.co/mYYjY8yUsQ
My driving licence has more points than this game #bbcnfl #SuperBowl
The Rams offense is playing like they’re more than happy to skip out on the fast food buffet at the White House. #SuperBowl
Mi raccomando eh, domattina tutti esperti di football americano. #SuperBowl
Imagine a Super Bowl with a football score. Bro Man city and Arsenal scored more than a game where you get 6 for a TD
Super Bowl highlights:

- First FG missed at the Mercedes-Benz stadium

- Longest punt in Super Bowl history

It’s almost 2am #SuperBowl
Yeah...that halftime show .....wasnt it #SuperBowl
This Super Bowl has been a wanky occasion. Not banter. Not banter at all. #SuperBowl
First Super Bowl I’ve watched and I can well and truly say a don’t have a clue what’s gan on and it’s boring as fuck
#bbcnfl People complaining about SB 53 but used to watching regular season football being a supporter of a Defence franchise. 

@markchapman can Osi or JBELL guess my team? 

Answer Baltimore Ravens

#SuperBowl
This #superbowl is a real test of stamina and endurance

But I’m battling through and staying awake
You know it’s been a bad game when you’re celebrating a longest punt in Super bowl history😂😂 #SuperBowl
Even José Mourinho thinks this is too pragmatic! #SuperBowl
Was not expecting such a defensive #Superbowl after this season of crazy offense!
While I wring in hope for my @Patriots, this is very good... 🤪#EverythingWeGot #SuperBowl https://t.co/CN5k3rxJlQ
@paddypower this is sporting narcolepsy #SuperBowl
Adam going shirtless has been the best thing about this Super Bowl so far 😍🔥🙄 #SuperBowl2019 https://t.co/nxQ3NTf4eW
They’re not missing much. #SuperBowl https://t.co/mmtrtu3uXM
Longest punt in #SuperBowl history by 1 yard😭🤣😂 greatest Super Bowl ever 😂😂 #Defence!
I am here for the longest punt in the #superbowl and nothing else
“It’s getting exciting now!” The Americans finally understanding why we love cricket when they cheer the longest punt in #SuperBowl history! 🇺🇸🏏🏈🇬🇧
“You know is a low-scoring game when you get excited about a record breaking punt” 🤣 TRUE #SBLIII #superbowl
@NFLUK sooooooo will The Rams offence actually turn up to London 2019, because they haven’t bothered for the SuperBowl!
Can we have some points please? #SuperBowl #LARams
God, imagine spending £20,000+ to watch this 😅😂 #SBLIII #SuperBowl #bbcnfl
Hekker for NVP  #SuperBowl
Such a pity the refs fucked it and the experienced Brees wasn't out here tonight instead of Goff #SuperBowl
Hier sind die besten Ultimate Frisbee Highlights aus der @theAUDL Season 2018, falls jemand kein #SuperBowl2019 mag💫

Thank you NFL for saving one of the worst games of the season for the SuperBowl 💤💤 #BBCNFL #SuperBowl53 #NFL #Dull #Boring #AntiClimax
”Longest punt in #Superbowl history” says it all really.  #SuperBowl2019
What’s the point of this? Boring. Not exactly playing to entertain the crowd. Christ 🙄 #SuperBowl
May as well have put Darren Gough at QB tonight. Goff being totally shut down here #bbcnfl #SuperBowl
Punt stats are the highlight of the game?! WTF? #SuperBowlLlll #SuperBowl
Johnny Hekker MVP

#SuperBowl
I imagine this is like watching an EPL game with no shots on target but a corner got given which went straight out of play for a goal kick #SuperBowl
Goff looking more panicked than a teenage boy trying to explain his way out of being caught wanking for the first time by his mum. #SuperBowl
To think this could of been an interesting superbowl if this had been called #SuperBowl https://t.co/jIIZbvkMl6
After missing last year's superbowl, edelman is here to prove something,  a badass squirrel. 🐿️ #gopats #SuperBowl #SBLIII
This is a Super Bowl José Mourinho is very much enjoying.
What's the biggest sporting anticlimax in history? Apart from this #SuperBowl obviously
LONGEST PUNT IN SUPER BOWL HISTORY 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
If rams don’t go for the punt in the 4th down and lose it here then Pats are defo in for the first touchdown of the game #SuperBowl
#SuperBowl well there goes my last reason to live https://t.co/9OU5LISBgz
Watching the super bowl in the UK on @BBC and just realised that we’re missing all the new commercials and movie trailers because it’s the bbc... ffs you think I’m watching this for the sport!?
The best part of the Super Bowl halftime show was spongebob’s bit.
Could this possibly be the lowest scoring Super Bowl? Both defences have been brilliant #BBCNFL
It was....ok. maybe tried to do too much #HalftimeShow #SuperBowl #Maroon5
Highkey this is the most boring superbowl to watch in at least a decade sheesh
We Stan edelman, we Stan the squirrel, we Stan Jules, we Stan Julian Edelman. #SuperBowl #SBLIII #GoPats
This what the #SuperBowl is all about @IMS https://t.co/Mkx5D4Kh3y #ThisIsMay #Indy500
I hate to criticise a young coach like mcvay but so far he’s bottling his time on the big stage. No disgrace losing in the Super Bowl to patriots but this is losing with a wimper
Watching the super bowl and I don’t understand what’s going on
This game is toooough. #SuperBowl #GoPats
Emergency Merlot has been distributed #SuperBowl
@SuperBowl Bring @RealHughJackman, @kealasettle and @GreatestShowman in for the half time show next year please 😁❤️
I’m a BEARS fan and I find the “defensive game” apologism for this snooze fest ridiculous. Good defence is great to see, this is just grindy #SuperBowl https://t.co/DAuyhYmWuV
@yossarian67 This might be the lowest Super Bowl score in history (precious 21)
@SachinPatel_87 @BrunoMars Yo Bruno what ya doing for the next 10 years?? fancy having a residency at  the Super Bowl final every year 😂
I really thought I wasn’t watching the super bowl 😑😑😑
Parkway Drive for next year's Super Bowl half time show? Think of the pyro!
@BBCSport            @London_Lions  Won   @BBLofficial Quarter final   @EnglandRugby Won 1st @SixNationsRugby game and @LondonBroncosRL Won their 1st @SuperLeague game   Come on @RamsNFL #NFL @SuperBowl #bbcnfl
Adam Levine defiantly took the knee #superbowl
Worst #SuperBowl ever?
@brits_endzone Edelman obviously listened to your podcast discussion on whether or not he should be in the Hall of Fame to give him motivation for the Super Bowl. 
#SuperBowl53 #MVP #HoF #BITEZ
@markchapman what’s the record for most punts in a Super Bowl game? Are we breaking it tonight? #bbcnfl #SBLIII
@Iromg @talkRADIO Hi Mike been a year since we had fun watching together. Nothing like a late night with mates. #superbowl #touchdown #Sack #superbowl points, points, points and #TomBrady you are looking gorgeous still. I would wouldn't you @soccerdiva @QueenSandy_CFC @beckynz yeah we so would.
I wish that half time show had been like 20% #Maroon5⁠ ⁠ and 80% #drumline.

They were so SICK. Drum lines are so damn cool, man. Could watch that for hours.🥁

#HalftimeShow #SuperBowlLlll #Super Bowl https://t.co/oLjk2qbLUM
This is the most un-interesting Super Bowl I’ve watched, and I’ve watched each one going back to SuperBowl XVIII #AntiClimax #SuperBowl53 #BBCNFL
Is it just me or did that halftime show suck? 🤔🤮 #SUPERBOWL #superbowl53 #SuperBowlLlll #SBLIII #NFL #americanfootball
Edelman alone has more yards than the Rams?
“Is it possible to be astonished and, yet at the same time, not surprised?” - @Pres_Bartlet #SuperBowl https://t.co/b69tAOLSwv
Edelman is MVP so far. #SuperBowl
Rams haven’t got a foothold in this game at all. #SuperBowl
Super Bowl 53... Go Rams... on defense #Defendtosavenotwin
Has a punter ever won the superbowl MVP, cause if not we could be about to witness history
Worst. Superbowl. Ever.
Think @Arsenal could do with some defensive lessons from these guys #SuperBowl
#SuperBowl #Edelman on🔥#BBCNFL
Amazing mystery prize. Signed @A_kamara6 shirt given away at our superbowl night. Congratulations to James Ross. #SuperBowl https://t.co/nqF46PFsmg
This non-use of Gurley is going to come back to haunt the Rams like the Seachickens not giving the ball to Lynch at the 1-yard line, isn’t it? #Superbowl #SBLIII #NFL #NFLUK
They just can’t stop Edelman! #SuperBowl
#bbcnfl Goff clearly cant hit a barn door tonight. Do the rams not have anyone to replace him @markchapman @BBCSport #SuperBowl
@BBCSport #SuperBowlLIII has there ever been a Super Bowl without a touchdown #Orkambinow
Watching Super bowl positives for across the pond:
I don’t really know

@1776Stonewall Super bowl? Is that a really big bowl with lots of big American food in it?
Hahahaha Goff is having a nightmare out there 😂 he's getting exposed, really not been a fan of him since his rookie year, McVay sure can hide a lot of weaknesses in a quarterback

#SuperBowl #NEvsLAR
Sadly, this game screams slow-burn Pats victory. 🏈 #SuperBowlLIII #NFL #SuperBowl2019
At the moment Goff playing like he did under Jeff Fisher 0/6 on 3rd down passing plays. Long game for @RamsNFL fans #SuperBowl

Genuinely think @marshmellomusic @FortniteGame performance was better than @maroon5 half time show 😬😬 I like maroon 5.. but that was pretty flat #SuperBowl
A reminder that the Rolling Stones, Prince, Tom Petty and Bruce Springsteen did the Super Bowl Halftime show in consecutive years. 

And now we’re resorting to wheeling out a trailer of steaming shit. #Maroon5
We’ve been watching for two hours solid and so far seen three points and heard three songs I kind of know (but didn’t ever attribute to Maroon Five). Fortunately Sunday night sleep isn’t precious or anything #SuperBowl

@iamErinMcAndrew I'm watching the #SuperBowl live for the 1st time here in the UK, because I don't have to get up for work in the morning! Although I have nooo idea what is going on &amp; also typically this is the 2nd lowest scoring SuperBowl ever! &amp; I didn't like the 1/2 performance either! #bbcnfl https://t.co/9W3wHsEzQm
Every time Hightower is mentioned, I just think of Police Academy, I keep expecting to see Mahoney &amp; Jones on the side line. 😂😂#SuperBowl #hightower #policeacademy
Going for the long haul with my first #SuperBowl - an enticing affair. Any of the guys want to hazard a guess at first touchdown scorer... if any?  #bbcnfl #SuperBowl2019 https://t.co/zulrVNozMz
This is genuinely a great Super Bowl if you like defencive football, but who likes defencive football
No idea what’s going on. Is this actually a sport? #SuperBowl2019
Superbowl half time report:
Maroon 5 are still shite.
I’m worried Evan Washburn may melt if he gets too close to the pyrotechnics! #SuperBowl

#PepsiHalftimeShow absolutely awful, sorry @maroon5 #SuperBowl
At 3-0, ye, you can pretty much use the “gotta treat it like the score is 0-0” cliche and it be basically true. #SuperBowl
#SuperBowl cup o’tea time again! Hope he’s ok!!
@JasonBell33 Hey Jason Looks like Harry's prediction of 31 -23 is going to be way out. If there is a crazy second Half are you  OSi an @markchapman going to do your #SuperBowlLlll  Dance? May be people will stay up to see it #BBCNFL   We need the New York Giants back at the next superbowl 1/2
Hey @mikegraham @beckynz a year since we sat up all night watching the #SuperBowl mind the score was higher than this. Its so exciting I can't tweet. Love you guys. I'm so excited 😬😬😬 More points please.

American football gets what American football deserves. The worst Super Bowl half time I’m living memory . Men wearing real fur .No solidarity
Again, this thread tells you all you need to know about the quality of the game and halftime show so far.
If a rubbish Super Bowl means we get an all-time great WrestleMania this year, I might actually take that trade.

That SuperBowl Half-Time show was not good in my opinion.
@paddypower Awful Super Bowl so far paddy
Worst half time show of all time. Travis Scott tragic. Big Boi the final straw. The fact my current alarm for work is Moves Like Jagger doesn’t help. Only consolation is a few of the lads had Adam Levine to take his top off at 16/1. 3-0 after 2nd quarter. Bed time #SuperBowl2019
So @foundersbrewing Super Bowl twitter game is strong this year...not a peep from @GooseIsland though after last year’s epic tweeting 🤨🍻 #SBLIII
Have @BuckyBrooks and @ProfBlackistone ever been seen in the same place at the same time? #doppelgangers #SuperBowl #SB53
Really impressive production again on the #superbowl #PepsiHalftimeShow - but incredibly clunky &amp; failed attempts again to try &amp; cut the Pepsi credit out of the world feed. It can’t be that difficult?!
...@VelveteenWWE just had a bigger moment during the #SuperBowl than Prince could of ever hoped for!
#bbcnfl Maroon 5 were an inspired choice for the #SuperBowl half time show. They made that first half look exciting.
The super bowl halftime show should be a women’s only event, they consistently deliver every year. Madonna, Beyoncé, GaGa and even Katy to an extent, I don’t know why we even entertain the idea of men performing. It’s just not realistic. https://t.co/vlNFYvHL7k
@fergusboden Harry Kane in a patriots top made me think of people that voted no to Scottish independence and yes to brexit because they were told it would win and did it without getting any more information. #dontatme #SuperBowl2019
Worst HT show ever? #HalftimeShow #SuperBowl2019  put me to sleep
Well that has got to be most boring #SuperBowl #HalftimeShow  ever *yawn*
What did you think of Maroon 5 at the #SuperBowl?

You can see why Maroon 5 gave their appearance fee to charity, awful halftime show. Prob the worst I’ve seen. #SuperBowl #Maroon5
You sometimes wonder whether the #Superbowl's halftime show planners have ever been to an actual concert IRL. Or whether they just create an ad version of what they think one would look and feel like. https://t.co/e9B6tU5mrJ

The super bowl is double boring....I will persist a while longer though.
Maroon 5, lit 🔥#superbowl #HalftimeShow
Getting woke up by the #SuperBowl half time show &amp; seeing a half naked @adamlevine 😱😱😱
The Handmaid’s Tale Super Bowl teaser: “Wake up, America,” demands June in parody of Reagan ad https://t.co/KvN9Y2gAgk via @voxdotcom
What a shit #SuperBowl #HalftimeShow one of the worst ever, maybe as bad as Coldplay. I suppose after that first half we had to expect it.
The DFS Sale is shorter than the #SuperBowl
I don't understand what is so difficult. Left shark and you are half way home. #SuperBowl
Youve gone from superbowl half-time shows with performances over the years from the likes of diana ross, aerosmith, the who, the rolling stones, bruce Springsteen (to name a few) 

To the likes of Katy Perry bruno mars and Maroon fucking five... 

What a load of shite
Commentator just said "let's remind ourselves of the stats of the first half" I was having trouble remembering what it was I'd even stayed up for 😴😴 #SuperBowl
@DustStorm It was just a concert. Superbowl half time is supposed to be one of the greatest events of the year
Halftime show could of been better! #NFLSunday #SuperBowl
Wonder if I’ll understand the game by the end of the match? #SuperBowl
Haven’t watched any of the actual #SuperBowl but this halftime show is dross when it COULD’VE been Bros. https://t.co/Hcr0QUkZuR
What a terrible half time show! To think music legends have played this event! #shambles #superbowl #BBCNFL
Well I've seen some #SuperBowl halftime shows. But that took the biscuit. Just a little on the garbage side. Maroon 5 and others just not up there to compare with huge artists that have come before them.
#SBLIII #SuperBowlLIII
Well this is the worst half time show I’ve ever seen at a super bowl 👀 #SuperBowl #SBLII
Need to run the ball #Rams #Superbowl
This #HalftimeShow is tripe! Some kind of cacophony of random support acts and Adam Levine slowly stripping. Awful. #SuperBowl2019
Well colour me underwhelmed. If the #PepsiHalftime show were a colour it would be beige. #superbowl #SBLIII
#SuperBowl Oh look, a prick in a fur coat. Fuck sake 'Murica, it's not big and it's not clever. That aside, really scraping the barrel with Maroon 5. What a creep!
That half-time show kinda sums up the game in general #SuperBowl
Is Adam Levine gay? #HalftimeShow #SuperBowl
So glad Half Time Heat was an option, that Super Bowl half time show was 😴. Velveteen &gt; Maroon 5 every time! #HalfTimeHeat
Well the Superbowl could have 20 TDs in the 2nd half and it still wouldn't be as good as #HalftimeHeat
Yes!!! 3 more points has surely sealed it for them now

#Patriots 13-3 #Rams 
#SuperBowl
🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆 @Patriots #SuperBowl
Game over, #GoPats win the #SuperBowl 
Brady with 6 rings, unbelievable
That’s game!! #SuperBowl
Shit super bowl 🙄
@Patriots #SuperBowl #Champions 🏆🍾🏈  #EverythingWeGot #SuperBowlLIII #Patriots  #bbcnfl   13-3
Tom Brady 6 Superbowl wins 9 appearances 👏👏👏
Can’t argue with this unfortunately. Patriots were better tonight. Just means those dynasty quotes, smug Brady and Giselle’s fake sport fan celebrations for the next few days 🤢 #SuperBowl
Where was Andre 3000 for the half time show?! #SuperBowl
Probably due a rubbish Super Bowl after the last few years but that was fuckin awful!
Should be a run for me. Close it out. #SuperBowl #SBLIII
Can I pre-emptively complain about the fact that the team’s owner gets to collect the trophy? It’s absolutely revolting. 🤮 #SuperBowl
McVay getting panned for the decision to not take the penalty. #NotSmart #SuperBowl
God bless the BBC pundits trying to hype thousands of people during a gigantic shithouse game. This Super Bowl has been severely wank!!!
I feel for the Rams coach. He looks so sad. He should win just for being fit 👍🏻🤷🏻‍♂️ #SuperBowl
The genius of Bellichick is that no way this team should have even made the Superbowl never mind won it! #SuperBowl2019
This years #superbowlads have been different we must say. The world is being taken over by robots, corn syrup, clever technological advances &amp; of course Avocados! We can’t decide our favourite right now how about you? (Maybe the NFL themselves?) #adbowl #superbowl
Welp... This Superbowl fit perfectly with how I felt about this game in the build up to it. Disinterested then. Seriously under- entertained now. 

Eagles would have beaten both these teams. 

Hats off to the Pats. 6 is impressive. No matter how they were won. 👏
Two Minute Warning: The Patriots have won the Super Bowl. No coming back for the Rams now. https://t.co/ThGvS7pqwh

Finally someone scored a try in the #SuperBowl took their time
trying to understand #NFL #SuperBowl #bbcnfl https://t.co/kcU5uWddaR
Brady. 🐐 #superbowl
Loving Romo on commentary. Really knowledgeable but entertaining as well. #SuperBowl #SBLIII
Gronkowski Is My MVP in this Dead Super Bowl 💀
Get on with it so we can go to bed. Surprised I’ve stayed awake. What a boring fucking game #superbowl
An intriguing but slightly underwhelming Super Bowl really. Patriots the better team by a mile and deserve to be on the verge of victory. #SuperBowlLIII
Worst Super Bowl ever! #SBLIII
“Hello, 9-1-1? I’d like to report a murder. The victim is the #LARams’ credibility. Do I have any idea who did it? ...Well, the LA Rams, I guess.” #SuperBowl
This has to be the deadest super bowl ever #SuperBowlLlll
1st down and it's over with the lowest scoring Superbowl ever (13 points today, compared to 21 as the 2nd lowest).
Otherwise Goff has 30seconds to make history

#SuperBowlLIII #NEvsLAR
Rams are the worst team in a Super Bowl for years. 

The SB itself has been a defensive standoff and I like it #SBLlll
😩🙈🏈 #SuperBowl #GoRams #LARams https://t.co/RUpM1zp3Pl
I’m not watching the Super Bowl thingy, I just don’t sleep.
That may be game over. Patriots have deserved this, by far the better team tonight. #SuperBowl
Lmao thats gonna be a meme #SuperBowl
#superbowl that's game.
#SuperBowl winning drive right there. Game over
This is the game winning drive right here, Patriots closing in on the Super Bowl
Start the car. #SuperBowl
Come on, #LARams.
I fancy a bit of overtime here, because a 3am finish is way too early! #NFLUK #SuperBowl
@MiniChikou Ca s'appelle pas le Super Bowl pour rien!
Drew Brees must be going crazy over the wasted opportunity by the Rams to upset this woeful Patriots offense 😱 must really feel like this Superbowl should be handed to them in 5 minutes' time

#SuperBowlLIII #NEvsLAR
@ibroxrocks @CemetryGates89 It gives me faith that it’s not impossible for Dak to win a championship. I mean, it’s quite impressive for both teams in the Superbowl to make me feel better about the Cowboys.
That’s game 
Patriots Super Bowl 53 winners
Tony Romo is the most knowledgeable commentator in all of sports. Absolutely love his insights on the game. Fantastic stuff. #SuperBowl
1/4 Home for the last quarter of the Super Bowl 👎🏻 last time I will be going to @CampandFurnace after what I have just witnessed. Coverage of the game via projector went off multiple times throughout the night and we ended up watching it on the Sky Go app.....
Hats off to the Patriots. Even though I was team Rams. #SuperBowl
#LARams Offense: “I can throw this game away faster than anyone!”
LA Rams Defense: “Hold our beer” #SuperBowl
Well that carry from Michel has probably sealed it. Any chance he could steal MVP from Edelman #SuperBowl2019 #Patriots
My view.. 1st qtr excited 2nd qtr sleepy 3rd qtr nodding off 4th OMFG... #Patriots #SuperBowl
Pats using every ounce of experience to see this out now, no better team or QB to be able to do that now #SuperBowl
This game is over. #SuperBowl
Have we gone back 3 years and Jeff Fisher is in charge of this Rams team??? #SuperBowl
How this is only 1 score is baffling. As Jared Goff is doing his best to lose this. #SuperBowl #NEvsLAR
Worst superbowl ever!
I’m really looking forward to all the ‘Brady ain’t the goat of you only score 10 in the big game’ debates. #SuperBowl
#SuperBowl #SBLIII https://t.co/scQjI9rPsb
Fucked it 🤭#goff #SuperBowl2019
@NeilDonohoe Quite possibly, no definitely THE worst SuperBowl I’ve been unfortunate enough to endure
My review of American football and the superbowl? #PISH
#bbcnfl, brilliant Superbowl, this may be Brady and Belichick swansong and they're going out in style.  @OsiUmenyiora @JasonBell33 @markchapman
ASMR? #SuperBowl
You kidding me, Goff? #SuperBowl https://t.co/reIzDPF0uU
Game over #SuperBowl
This game has been beyond frustrating! #LARams were so close to a touchdown and then we would have had a GAME! #SuperBowl
What an INTERCEPTION Gilmore!!! @Patriots #EverythingWeGot #GoPats #SBLlll #SuperBowl 🏈🤩
Sean McFraud 

#SuperBowl2019
Booooooom! #interception #SuperBowl2019
Game over?
#superbowl
Even I know Goff shouldn't have thrown that pass #SuperBowl
@JasonBell33 These superbowl refs don't seem to know what pass interference is today that was shameful What a bunch of cheats #NewEnglandPatriots  #SuperBowlLIII  #bbcnfl
WHAT A PICK BY GILLMORE!! #GoPats #SuperBowl
Tough job trying to name an MVP for this #SuperBowl ... wouldn’t be surprised to see Tony Romo get it
That could be game over. 😫 #SuperBowl
YAAAAAAAAAS!!!!! Interception!!!!! @patriots #SuperBowl @ Woking https://t.co/jJ9pRHMvYk
Last ten mins been better. At least we’ve had a touchdown now. #SuperBowl
I Cannae speak wtf was that #SuperBowl
This superbowl 😴😴😴
Worst Super bowl performance by a QB ever? I can't think of a worse one?
What a time for an interception, game defined by class, Brady got it right, Goff has got it wrong all night! #SuperBowl
Game over...Goff has been rubbish today, I'm gutted! #SuperBowl🏈
AT LAST!! #SuperBowl2019 #SuperBowlLIII #SBLIII
BOOM #GoPats #SuperBowl #SBLlll
#SuperBowl Gilmorrrrreeee!!!
GILLY GILLY!!
#SuperBowl #SBLIII #StillHere #GoPats #EverythingWeGot
That’s pass interference surely? Gilmore has Cooks arm. Not given and next play Gilmore gets the pick. So Patriots. #SuperBowl
I remember my first Superbowl

Big fan of Sean McVay. It’s a bit weird to see a head coach who looks younger than most of his players #SuperBowl
still waiting for Burt Reynolds to score the winning Touchdown #SuperBowl
Bears could have beaten both these teams tonight... #SuperBowl #whatcouldhavebeen
Fucking hell, about twatting time! #TOUCHDOWN #PATRIOTS #SuperBowl
A touchdown after what feels like a lifetime. 
Unfortunately, the evil empire get the points ...
#SUPERBOWL
Against the #Patriots you gotta earn the #SuperBowl
#Rams haven’t done it so they won’t. That’s the Ball game.
Sony Michel?
😎
😎

I prefer Toshiba Michel

 #superbowl⁠ ⁠
TOUCHDOWN‼️‼️ #GoPats #SuperBowl #EverythingWeGot  🏈
A Super Bowl winning play? To say this has been tense would be a massive understatement 😳 https://t.co/g3xFSeMIJH
Finally a touchdown #Superbowl https://t.co/cZeC76cOsG
#SuperBowl Défense you’re up #Patriots
Pains me, but there’s only one choice #SuperBowl https://t.co/uwfXPmZX7c
That was a brilliant drive from the Patriots. #SuperBowl
What a play #TomBrady... Yes Gronk! #SuperBowl 🏈 #GoPats
You’re never gonna keep Brady quiet for a whole game. Rams continue to not cover Edelman, and finally pay for it. Michel only the 2nd rookie to get a SB rushing TD I believe. Now the Rams have to turn on an offence that hasn’t got going! #SuperBowl
Gronk* won this game, not Brady. Let’s be real #SuperBowl

*As long as we pretend the referees aren’t a factor
Up all night watching the #Superbowl  finally a touchdown!!! #SuperBowlSunday #SuperBowl2019 https://t.co/OfHLpnzaQ5
TOUCHDOWN SONY MICHEL!!
About bloody time, LFG!!! 🏈
#SuperBowl #SBLIII #StillHere #GoPats #EverythingWeGot
Brady &gt; Gronk #Legend #SuperBowl
There's a guy wearing a checked shirt with a striped tie on sky sports coverage of the Superbowl. #embarrassing #NFL #superbowl
The @Patriots are going to bloody do it again, aren't they? 😠 #SuperBowl #SBLIII
Finally! #SuperBowl https://t.co/hqkSOpF5Es
A TOUCHDOWN HAPPENED, IS THIS ALLOWED? WHAT HAPPENS NOW? DO THEY HAVE TO PUNT IT STILL? WOW #SuperBowl https://t.co/kmMHLtJgY7
First male cheerleader in #SuperBowl history, so it’s ironic that someone called Michel scores the first touchdown
If the Rams could score two TD’s now, I’d be very appreciative. I’d like to win my 17-10 scoreline bet please #superbowl #SBLIII
TOUCHDOWN! #SuperBowl #Atlanta
Oh, a touchdown? #SuperBowl https://t.co/o2cT2QvhWl
What a catch by Gronk! What a drive! Let’s fucking go!!!!! #SuperBowl #GoPats
Go Pats! #SuperBowl
These superbowl tweets are boring me.
Boooooooooom!!! #superbowl
TOUCHDOWN NEW ENGLAND!!! 🤘🏼🤘🏼🤘🏼🤘🏼 #SuperBowl #Patriots
Halle-fucking-lujah! Mid way through the fourth quarter and we finally have a touchdown! #SuperBowl #bbcnfl
There we go #GoPats #SuperBowl #SBLlll
And with that, I’m going to my bed! 🙈 #SuperBowl2019 #SuperBowl53
Ball game. No way The Rams come through after what they’ve put up thus far #SuperBowl
More than halfway through the 4th quarter and the first play in the red zone. Thank god it ended in a touchdown. #SuperBowl #SBLIII
#SuperBowl Breakthrough!!! #Michel #EverythingWeGot @Patriots Come Onnnnnnnnnn!!!
TOUCHDOWN! About time! #SuperBowl
YAAAAAAAAAS!!! #TOUCHDOWN @patriots #SuperBowl @ Woking https://t.co/FwdshaB2tl
I love Gronk #Superbowl #SBLIII #PatriotsNation
Yes!!! Touchdown #patriots

#Patriots 10 - 3 #Rams

#SuperBowl
Game over😢 #SuperBowl53 #SuperBowl
Should we not be pointing out that the @NHLJets had as many goals in the first period the other day as both team have points in a game where you can get 6 points on one play? #SuperBowl
Touchdown... Finally #SuperBowl
It's about time #Touchdown
#SuperBowl
Finally touch down #SuperBowl #gopats https://t.co/WzUmwHhYx1
#Gronk #Superbowl
TOUCHDOWN #GoPats #SuperBowl
Superb pass and catch earlier to set it up
Enfin ... TOUCHDOWN @Patriots ! #SuperBowl
FINALLY

#SuperBowl
Finally! Touchdown! Brady turning it on when it’s needed! #SuperBowl
#SuperBowl The Rams performance in 3 words:

Guess we'll punt ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
YES!!!!! #Patriots #superbowl
About time!! #SuperBowl #bbcnfl
Ha so many ppl around in the bar  ...zzzz zzzz 😂  #SuperBowl
Holy fuck finally thank God for that #SBLIII #SuperBowl
*Keels over in shock* #SuperBowl #SBLIII
Can't sleep. Should have kept watching #SuperbOwl is it really still going?
FINALLY #SuperBowl
The Gronk! #SuperBowl
3-3 in the 4th quarter ??? This super bowl is appalling https://t.co/gKOVicBdNI
And that’s the game #SuperBowl
LETS FUCKING GO #SuperBowl
Edelman MVP #SuperBowl
What's the score?
3-3 
Is the superbowl the final of hockey game? #SuperBowl
Like a @Stevie_Poacher #SuperBowl2019 zzzzzz
There’s only one thing left to do with this Super Bowl  #SuperBowl https://t.co/504hfRc65O
Starting to look tired here and Goff Is playing like a rookie #SuperBowl2019 #rams #Patriots
Brady and Gronkowski pairing has always been one of my favourites to watch #SuperBowl
I can’t believe I’m staying up to 3AM to watch this #SuperBowl...

#Yawn
I’m calling it now Gronk touchdown to win SuperBowl in his final game! #NEvsLAR
This is like an SEC game from the early 80s @HailStateFB 6 Bama 3! #superbowl #SuperBowlLIII
Goff is definitely playing terribly, a lot of that going round. But that phantom holding call is not the only time the refs have made conspicuously bad choices in the Pats favour tonight #SuperBowl
I sense Brady time is coming! 🙈 #SuperBowl
I feel like that call on offensive holding was needlessly picky   #SuperBowl
Why doesn’t the male cheerleader get Pom poms #bbcnfl #skynfl #nfl #SuperBowl2019
Ref making calls for Pats #SuperBowl
#bbcnfl If the #SuperBowl is tied 3-3 at full time can they just agree to share the trophy, please? I’m not sure I can take O/T with these two.
quite possibly best super bowl defensively wise ever
Am I really going to watch the #SuperbOwl for the first time and not see a touchdown?!
Vaya desastre de líneas ofensivas en #SuperBowl2019 vamos #NewEnglandPatriots ahora le toca a #Brady demostrar por qué es una leyenda.
Probably the most depressing SuperBowl ever.
Give me a touch down....anyone, any team. I don’t care anymore @NFL #SuperBowl
Why does the male #Rams cheerleader not have pom-poms? And why is he not wearing a crop top and hot pants? #SuperBowl #SBLIII
This is why @dallascowboys should have been in this game!  #SuperBowl
#SuperBowl why doesn't the male cheerleader have pompoms?
Last thought for the night on the Nfl Super Bowl is that the only Scottish cunts interested are insomniacs, alkys and speed n coke heads. Night shift ma arse Sarah you’ve been cleaning the house aw night fulla paste.
Brady has enough speed to get to the sideline? 😂 #SuperBowl https://t.co/8mV4AkN0kR
Not so Super SuperBowl
That "...like the winner has to go to the White House" is deffo tomorrow's "...and everyone made the same joke", isn't it? #SuperBowl
I wish somebody would lay down a bunt or start the runner, anything to get a runner over the 50yd line in this game #SuperBowl 

#SuperBowl53
Man, this is getting tense now. Kinda feel like one big play wins it. #SuperBowl
This could be the first SuperBowl won by a safety (2pts). #BBCNFL
Every year I make an effort to really get into the Super Bowl and every year I’m disappointed. But this year, wow, it’s no different. #bbcnfl
Next year I wanna be at the super bowl
The winners of the super bowl are NOT World Champions #BBCnfl
This is awful #SuperBowl
Did they seriously just go for a run play on a 3rd and 22 what is this   #SuperBowl https://t.co/DvTB2jA7zz
This is tense yo! #SuperBowl
My favourite part of the superbowl halftime show was Travis Scott being muted only to be Unmuted for the word "bitch". Top notch censoring. #SBLIII #SuperBowl #HalftimeShow
#puntbowl #nfl #superbOwl
I feel sorry for Goff @JaredGoff16 #SuperBowl
If only the Chiefs had beaten the Patriots two weeks ago, then this game would be 33-33 right now #SuperBowl
WTF was that call? #SuperBowl
@Nes_mk2 @Si_23Q @chrisetty Was at super bowl 2017 in Houston Texas, still know clues to how it works? The only person I knew then was lady gaga at half time
Never thought I’d say this Tony Romo is the best quarterback in Super Bowl 53. “We got POINTS!!!” 

@GuySpencer15 @BwaySHO
Somebody's gotta win but honestly I'm not sure either of them deserve it after this game #SuperBowl
Most boring game ever #SuperBowl
Watching Superbowl 53  Come on @RamsNFL and @NewEnglandPatr Let's get some action or is this the first super bowl where a punter gets mvp and there are no touchdowns. #SuperBowlSunday #defence https://t.co/LOgcXQtdOw

Are the @RamsNFL set to be the most undeserving Super Bowl winners ever?!? #BBCNFL #SuperBowl xx
Forgive the stupid question. Should the game end 3-3, what happens?

What an awful Super Bowl so far
I think this last ten mins have been too exciting for me. Let’s get back to some good old fashioned punting  #SuperBowl https://t.co/PPsa2wFM7t
I've took holiday to watch this pish #SuperBowl come on #GoPats
Do you find this Super Bowl... #SBLIII
Don’t care who scores, I just can’t watch this go into overtime! #SuperBowl
#SuperBowl on tv #JackDaniels #Tennesseefire in my glass, my little dog snuggling up in my bed, and relatively pain and #anxiety free I have to say a forced #fibromialgia slow day is starting to pay off! Nice start to the week for a change.
@BBCSport thank you #shoutout ?
More interesting reading than tonight's yawnfest of a #SuperBowl https://t.co/6rUgQI6xBj
@beckynz 😱 Oy Vey its exciting. My poor ticker. No wonder #superbowl MP doesn't watch he'd have less than a 1/3 working.

Dios mío que #SuperBowl tan aburrido. Sospecho que hay desabasto de anotaciones porque el demagogo cerró los ductos de la diversión… #AndrésYaLaRegasteOtraVez
Why do the offensive chase the ball after the punt, what are they hoping for? #SuperBowl #bbcnfl
Why do the offensive chase the ball after the punt, what are they hoping for? #SuperBowl
This is the most boring superbowl i have ever watched #SuperBowl
Super Bowl "Yawn" but still come on  The Pats!!!.
What an exciting super bowl!! #NFL #SuperBowl #NFLUK
Damnnnn can we get a touchdown??? #SuperBowl
Has there ever been a Gary linekar moment at the nfl super bowl when they bend over in blast a tacho bell or sloppy joes aw over their uniform trousers
What’s the highest amount of punts ever in a Super Bowl? This game must be up there.
Most defensive #superbowl ever!
This’d be so much better a game had the @saints got to to the Super Bowl #FuckKroenke
First #superbowl to have a punter as MVP?? #SuperBowlLIII
Has a #SuperBowl ever gone to overtime? #bbcnfl

...jaeger when we finally get a TD. Only been waiting an hour and half...#SuperBowl
That was not worth staying up til 4am. I’m gunna be tired and grumpy all day tomorrow and it wasn’t even worth it. I vote we get a Saints v Chiefs 3rd place playoff game just to make the end of season more interesting. #SuperBowl #MostBoringSuperbowlEver #bbcsuperbowl #NFLUK

So the first full Super Bowl I've managed to watch the whole way through and it wasn't the best game but @Patriots only went and won. 20 years I've been a fan and now 6 #superbowl wins #EverythingWeGot and @Edelman11 getting #MVP was well deserved. #bbcnfl https://t.co/LBY9U2NLUe
@Trump45_USA1st @ConservaMomUSA Yes and no! Wasn’t bothered to watch, but still wanted the Brady bunch to win! #SuperBowl
Worst Super Bowl, Worst Half Time, Best Team in the NFL @Patriots #WorthEveryMinute #SuperBowlLIII
They would have won easily.
Worst Superbowl Ever! https://t.co/O5qThhLRcd
Was that a Superbowl worthy of staying up till 4am? I'm not so sure?

I think Tom Brady probably deserves to be carried to at least one Super Bowl by his defence. They owe him one after his performance last year. #SuperBowlLlll #GoPats
Such a sick season this year, but such a boring/predictable super bowl
give the super bowl trophy too 21 savage #21Savage
As high as the #SuperBowl is, the low of realising that’s the end of 🏈 until September is tough. Stay strong, football fans.
I’ll bet the TV company’s just can’t wait to put the lowlights packages together for the worst SuperBowl in history, Pats won by being the least poor on the day #SuperBowlLlll #SBLIII #NFL #WorstSuperBowlEver
Tom Brady 🐐 #SuperBowl #Patriots
@AndyCarlsonShow I'd rather the saints made the superbowl and gave the pat's a game. Fuck the pats.
I said this last year after the loss to the eagles and I stand by what I said this Superbowl is the biggest achievement!!! #EverythingWeGot https://t.co/9UN9dtYP1W
The super bowl was pish.
How could anyone who is not a Patriots fan possibly enjoy that? #SuperBowl

Probably the worst Super Bowl I’ve watched since I’ve been a fan, gutted to see Brady win but McVay has a great career ahead as a Coach.
Don’t know what it is about the @Patriots but they somehow find an extra gear in the play- offs and #Superbowl ! Huge credit to Brady &amp; co! Tied with @steelers with 6 Super Bowl trophies! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
So... #HalftimeHeat and getting a like off @_JenLouise_ are definitely the highlights of #SuperBowl Weekend!!

#SuperbOwl beer 4 - w00t indeed. Rich lovely stout with a sweet pecan touch, jacked up by the Bourbon finish. Way better than the result. Nice to see Will Wheato... (Drew Curtis / Wil Wheaton / Greg Koch Stone Farking Wheaton W00tstout (2018)) https://t.co/ffs4vRtToy
Buzzing! Well done to @Patriots another one for the collection #superbowl #GoPats #EverythingWeGot
Four Super Bowl, three wins. Vicente should be the new Pats’ mascot. 😍#skysportsnfl #patriotsnation #superbowl @ London, United Kingdom https://t.co/zKLa59jWkm
@DanielRuddick patriots won 13-3 mate #Superbowl
Bed time for me now after watching the #SuperBowl
All these people saying it was a bad Superbowl need to watch more #NFL 
And realise that there is more to it than just touchdown passes.
#bbcsuperbowl #SBLIII 
Oh and great coverage by the BBC, shame about halftime.
I thought about watching the Super Bowl. But then realised I had a 4:30 start today. And now I’m up an hour before my alarm. And have just missed it it seems.
#bbcnfl one of the best defensive games of all time. #SuperBowl
Was there any chance Brady wasnt gonna win his 6th super bowl tonight?
Cowboys Super Bowl 54 champs!
"It wasn't terrible, it was different."

That's a hell of a spin the BBC are putting on this deathly dull #SuperBowl #bbcsuperbowl
Julian Edelman was clean shaven before Maroon 5 came on #SuperBowl
Edelman deserves MVP, defence had a great game and Tom Brady has his sixth #SuperBowl ring! 🙌🏻💪 #GoPats
Somebody will make a film about this #superbowl
“WORLD Champions” in a competition only opens to USA???. That makes me world champion of “My Flats Blow Football. #SuperBowlLIII #SuperBowl2019 #bbcnfl
Well that was the worst Super Bowl I have ever watched. Not just because of who won...but due to the fact it was dull as fuck. Even the half time show was shit... oh well...onto next season...
Thats definitely not Jim Nantes natural hair colour 😂 😂 #superbowl
Well deserved. 👏 Interesting to see the Super Bowl MVP go to an offensive player after a 13-3 game nonetheless.

Near-perfect performance from the Pats defence tonight, held a team averaging 32.9 PPG this season to 3. Stephon Gilmore standout and got win-sealing pick. #SBLIII https://t.co/FMAcKMjnAG
Coach, convicted cheat

QB, convicted cheat

MVP, convicted cheat

GG guys, go fornicate with yourselves
#Superbowl
I loved having to watch the super bowl at 2 am lol it’s okay cuz the whole base got the day off tomorrow🤪🤪
It's 3.30am and I'm never getting that part of my life back #superbowl
Brady right now! Ha! #SuperBowl https://t.co/t8h4rgkVHS
Deserved the MVP #SuperBowl
The best #SuperBowlCommercial tonight was for #XFL2020 and it was called #SuperBowlLIII #SuperBowl #XFL
Maroon 5 was an odd choice for the #superbowl but I can’t deny thet Adam Levine is still a fucking hunk. https://t.co/oHaAgWHldr
Well, that wasn’t really a classic. #SuperBowlLIII #SuperBowl53 #SuperBowl2019
.@NFL is brilliant but the owners giving the first victory speech at #superbowl is wrong
Not gonna win any new fans that one, but a fascinating stalemate #SuperBowl until the Pats outclassed the Rams totally. Can't argue with Brady being the 🐐 Historic night.
Why is @RicFlairNatrBoy lifting the #Superbowl trophy?
@thenflshowpod @Patriots 5 hours sleep lost!!  But just watched @NFL  history.   Congrats #PatriotsNation  the master coach  put the pupil back in his place. #SuperBowl  time for slee....p😴😴😴😴😴 🇬🇧🏈🇬🇧 https://t.co/PPGnBX8asl

I am so glad I sat up to 3:20am to watch that...one of the worst Super Bowls EVER (as a spectacle!!) - fair play to @Patriots as it was a tactical masterpiece!! The Dynasty rumbles on!! #SBLlll #SuperBowl2019 #ThanosBrady #TB12 #SuperBowlLIII
First time I’ve managed to stay up for the whole of the Super Bowl. Thoroughly enjoyed it 🏈. And great coverage by #BBCNFL
Bloody Patriots #SuperBowl
Well that was an absolute snore fest. #SuperBowl
I think it's fair to say that @budlight won the #SuperBowl commercial contest this year. It alone was better than that game 😴😴😴
I don’t understand a lot about this sport but even I could see that 
the New England Patriots were the better team and fully deserve to win #Superbowl #bbcnfl
That was a dog shit superbowl
@SNYtv Patriots are celebrating another super bowl and people are bringing up the Giants wins... not sure they care lads
Whilst loading up BBC iPlayer for the Super Bowl, I noticed @MayansFX is on there. I know what I’m definitely watching when I wake up later 😃#Happy #SOA
Patriots are incredible. Brady, Gronk, Edelman amazing. #SuperBowl #SBLIII 

Great coverage as ever #bbcnfl
Super Bowl 53: New England Patriots 13-3 Los Angeles Rams - Pats claim record sixth win - https://t.co/e8S726nRGH
Enjoyed my first super bowl https://t.co/ScbNFPNPWs
Complete contrast of a #SuperBowl to last year; game of the two defences. Great battle though and hugely impressive that the @Patriots have done it again.
@mserinmary Well done, even with the Rams in the Super Bowl
@JasonBell33 Bill wins another Superbowl !! Is this Osi and @markchapman #SuperBowlLIII #bbcnfl  Dancing or Bill and Adopted Son Brady? https://t.co/pzo2K6MB9t

Dolphins beat the Pats so in some way we are Super Bowl champs
When was last time a city won both #SuperBowl and #WorldSeries in same year ?

@NFL @SuperBowl @Edelman11 @Winsamsoon
A great ending to an amazing weekend!!! Congratulations New England @Patriots !!! #SuperBowl Champs!!! https://t.co/V80N9Uu0HX
Not as thrilling as other years possibly but a great defensive #Superbowl from both teams. A shame for the @RamsNFL that they couldn’t get anything going but you can never dismiss the @Patriots #SBLlll #gopats 🏈
Not the greatest Super Bowl you’ll ever see but who cares!! World Champions and Brady and Bill get their 6th ring... GOATS 🐐 🏈🏆 @Patriots @NFL #EverythingWeGot #GoPats #SBLlll
They’ve done it again, the @Patriots win the Super Bowl. Unbelievable effort from 2 top defences, but the 🐐 TB12 wins another 💍 #SBLII #SuperBowlLIII #NFLUK #bbcsuperbowl 🏈🏈🏈
@ScottJFurtado Lowest scoring Super Bowl in history...😴
That Super Bowl was so bad as a spectacle I wish those refs had called pass interference in New Orleans
@milesds Wow, what a pair of legends. A combined six Super Bowl rings 😃
@NFLUK Per average fan, we probably drink more alcohol.
And need more Fridays and Mondays off work... 
...but thanks. Am #Superbowl https://t.co/xrBgLsNzQn
People talk about teams looking for a new coach and those  teams trying to find the next Sean McVay - nonsense, they should be looking for the next Bill Bellicheck #SuperBowl #bbcnfl  @ScotlandNFL

Awake at this hour? To watch Super Bowl?! Absolutely not! Tonsillitis makes a return 🤒🤕 genuinely feel like I’ve been hit by a 🚌- good way to end my birthday I suppose🙃
Unreal to win it with the defense playing their best game of the season. Criticised a lot this year, showed up when it mattered. That’s six, baby. #GoPats⁠ ⁠ #SuperBowl
Belichick &amp; 12 = 🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐
And Brian Flores: the Dolphins are getting an instant legend. #EverythingWeGot #SuperBowl
Never thought I would say this but well done Tom Brady and the Patriots. I hope Edleman wins MVP. #SuperBowl2019 https://t.co/OoesWVxeA9
Patriots win the Super Bowl (again) I’m feeling a bit deflategated #SuperBowlLIII #bbcnfl  #SuperBowlnaESPN #DeflateGate #PatriotsvsRams
YEEEEEESSSSS #Superbowl @Patriots
did America win? #superbowl
The Highlight of #SuperBowl https://t.co/FX8IDGvuT7
Worst game ever. Worst result ever. Worst QB performance ever. Worst half time show ever. Just put me in the bin #Superbowl
How shit were the rams offensively?? #SuperBowl2019
The Patriots are like the Real Madrid of European Football they just keep winning the big one. They’re that good it’s annoying. Every year I wish for someone else to win it but they still are in the mix. Congrats to them and especially Tom Brady, what a career. #SuperBowl
Awesome game. Defensive shoot out. Looking forward to the Seattle Seahawks making it back to the super bowl one day. Congratulations to the New England Patriots! 🏈 roll on September for the new season! #SuperBowl
A better love story than Twilight. #SuperBowl #Pats #EverythingWeGot https://t.co/UJhLZeSj9j

6 super bowls 🐐 #SuperBowl #gopats #TomBrady https://t.co/vFkqPJyTya
That is the worst #Superbowl I’ve watched in all my years of watching this sport
@Mike_Channon @MatthewLumby @NFL A coaching masterclass across the board. McVay &amp; the Rams will come again.  That was pure grind... #SuperBowl
Easily the least exciting #SuperBowl I have watched live. A phenomenal defensive performance from the Patriots and they deserved the victory. But I have zero desire to ever see this game again. #SBLlll #NFL #NFLUK
Well done New England Patriots, Nice to see Tom Brady win his 6th Super Bowl 🏟 #SuperBowlSunday
@JonnyRiley39 Crazy , Belichick is something else . Man could win a super bowl with a team of jelly babies
Bill Belichick is the greatest coach in the history of sport. To be that consistently exceptional in a league designed to stop it happening is incredible #Superbowl
...Brady....🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐 #SuperBowl
Apparently Tom Brady just won the super bowl? Despite doing fuck all
Highlight of the superbowl https://t.co/S342RNlUE3
That’s six @SuperBowl’s for Belichick and Brady – incredible!
🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆 #SBLIII⁠ 
For me, bed! https://t.co/pG7gsIhTx7
800 times more entertaining than the actual #SuperBowl https://t.co/iaBoNx0ion
A night where a bland #HalfTimeShow was more exciting than the actual #SuperBowl.
Neither team had the hunger for the win, a default result based on 1st defense to slip up against weak attack. 
Not worth discussing further, see you in September @NFL.
@SkySportsNFL #SBLIII
Greatest show on earth 😂😂😂💩won’t be watching a super bowl again!! Roll on the rugby World Cup no helmets no pads and 80mins of pure battle 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
That game was pure, unadulterated grind. Big credit to the @RamsNFL; McVay, Phillips superb. 

But what a win. What a defence. Jules or Sony for MVP, surely... #EverythingWeGot #SuperBowl
This super bowl was so poor, such a waste of lifetime. Goff.. Gosh..
Rams didn’t deserve to be in the Superbowl and from the way they’ve played tonight it’d seem they agree. @Saints SB 2020 winners, watch this space ✌🏻⚜️ #fucktherams #SuperBowl2019
#SuperBowl name me a more iconic duo ! https://t.co/FZY7Va0fwd
Liverpool celebrated a draw with West Brom better than the Pats are right now. Fuck em #SuperBowl2019
Gutted, but all credit to the Patriots who know how to win a Superbowl. What a season for the Rams. Onwards. https://t.co/nmGZcqJAck
@CraigieG73 I certainly have. Always clear the day after the SuperBowl. Hope you’ve got the day off as well. 😂😂😂
DEFENSE wins everything @Patriots #GoPats #SuperBowl #SBLlll 🏈🏈
This ridiculous media scrum would kill me. Just won the biggest title in your sport and you’re surrounded by 100 arseholes crushing you, stopping you from celebrating with your teammates. #SuperBowl

Stayed up watching the super bowl it was crap!💩
Well the Phoenix Open was absolutely more exciting than the Super Bowl. Congrats @RickieFowler!
Wonder who the patriots are playing next Super Bowl then 🙄🙄 #SuperBowlLIII
Glad to have seen @RamsNFL in a super bowl. I randomly picked them 3 seasons ago and they’ve done well. Well done to the @Patriots, even though it means my brother wins 😩
Nothing about this super bowl will live long in the memory. Patriots deserved the victory. Rams Offence non existent, MIA, not seen since robbing New Orleans. Credit to Bill Belichick for that. #SBLlll #NEvsLAR #NFLUK #NFL #SuperBowl #bbcnfl
That was the Phantom Menace of football games. #SuperBowl
Finished, apparently. Who knows? #SuperbOwl Still haven't got a scooby. The last two and a half minutes seemed to take the better part of an hour and nobody took the Hail Mary Pass, or something. Yaay Parrots!

Lisa is, unsurprisingly, objectively correct about this. As the lowest-scoring Super Bowl ever, it’s perfectly reasonable to call it the worst. https://t.co/iWgRMdSQBt
Hope Maroon 5 come on again. Said no one ever.  #Superbowl
Lowest scoring #SuperBowl ever as @Patriots secure their 6th win to equal @steelers at the top of the tree! The #Brady / #Belichick dynasty continues! #SBLIII
Worst #SuperBowl for a long time. Least it’s over an hour earlier than I thought.
The super bowl is garbage, tbh the whole NFL is trash 🗑
YYYYEEEESSSS!!! SUPERBOWL CHAMPIONS‼️‼️‼️ @Patriots #GoPats #SuperBowl #SBLlll 🏈🏈 #EverythingWeGot https://t.co/NeQnBzhCtQ
Superbowl to be desired...  However @Patriots phenomenal winners, dynistay established... Onto next season!!
That was a game for the defensive purists. Rams were just not good enough with the ball. Edelman MVP for sure! #superbowl
The only positive that can take away from this #SuperBowl is that I get to go to bed an hour earlier than I had anticipated
Congratulations to #Patriots to your 6th #SuperBowl  #GOAT #TomBrady
#OMG amazing game and 1 gung ho pass decides the game! Have to go 1 better in 2019 #GoRams #Proud #SuperBowl⁠ ⁠#SuperBowl53 still sad though 😥 #LARams
New England Patriots dominated LA Rams to win Super Bowl 53. Well done!!
#SuperBowl2019
Congratulations the #Patriots love or hate them you've got to admire them. To appear in so many Superbowls and win more than lose over a very short period of time is just incredible! #superbowl #SBLIII
Julian Edelman = #SuperBowl MVP

Patriots defence = Absolutely dominant!

Well played #Patriots #SBLIII #SuperBowl it was like watching two heavy weight boxers. #Patriots never looked like losing but #Rams defence was immense.
Nice to get to bed earliesh on #SuperBowl night. 

Fewer points = less time on the clock.

Least inspiring Bowl I’ve watched for sure. 

Cowboys vs Chiefs would have been more bants. Am #nextYear

As a Dolphins fan of 35 years I don’t like seeing the Patriots win any game from week one onwards. But I’ve got huge respect for Belichick and Brady, absolute titans of sport #SuperBowl
#SuperBowl Brady. Edelman. Gronkowski. And wow that @Patriots defence.
Might be the worst Super Bowl I’ve seen that one, Belichick out-coached them completely and Goff looked like a deer in the headlights
That media scrum at the end looks horrendous. #SuperBowl
PATRIOTS WIN THE #SuperBowl
BRADY IS THE GOAT. #6Rings
Last year’s Super Bowl featured the most efficient play execution in history. This was the exact opposite https://t.co/rGJGgZN9jq

Lets fucking go Patriots!🇺🇸🏈 Super Bowl Champions again!!!!🏆
Well I should've just watched the highlights tomorrow. What a poor offensive #Superbowl . Need my bed now.
Worst. Superbowl. Ever.
Shouldn’t allow the press and media on the pitch, Brady can’t move never mind celebrate, it’s a farce #SuperBowl
Absolutely ridiculous scenes. Feel sorry for Tom Brady in this situation. #SuperBowl
@BenKissel I didn’t get bummed by a Zebrah, so *not* the worst Superbowl ever!

I managed to sleep through the entire halftime show and wake up as the second half kicked off.

Wish I'd stayed asleep. #SuperBowl
Two ex Raiders win SuperBowl with cheating bastard patriots. 
😡😡
The Rams were terrible. The game was terrible. Half Time show was terrible. And I’m not sure Beer Twitter is in the best place after those million dollar adverts. 2019 was not a vintage #Superbowl
Really enjoyed this #SuperBowl actually. Always interesting to the end. Hard yards, ground out. Congratulations @Patriots and Mr Kraft 🙂👍
How many GOATS Brady, Belichick Patriots #SuperBowl
Worst #SuperBowl in recent memory. Made even worse by @Patriots winning the damn thing. No doubting Brady &amp; Belichik are the best ever, but I just don't like them! Ah well, go again next year... #SBLIII
Well that sums up the @TheNFLRams superbowl. Woeful.
Super Bowl Champions the New England Patriots 👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
6th super bowl win let’s fucking go🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆
It’s a shame that Goff will never be able to play football again after failing to read a defence in his first #superbowl
Can’t believe I’ve made it to the end of that game! I am now off to bed! Congrats Patriots #SuperBowl2019

Unpopular opinion, anyone that stayed up to watch Superbowl really needs to look at themselves, if it was on in the Back garden id chase them #superbowl #LoadOfShit #Bed
I don't know what's worse.. having the flu or waking up to find out the Patriots have won another Super Bowl 😫 #SuperBowl

When did his Super Bowl lark become a thing? #handegg
Sounds like going to bed and missing the Super Bowl was the right idea. That class will be getting deleted before viewing
#SuperBowl #HalftimeShow is the American equivalent of #Eurovision. Although instead of being filled with a wide range of songs from across the continent, it's just full of poor ghetto people rapping and Adam Levine's nipples. #SBLIII #Maroon5
Best part of the American Super Bowl? 

We’re asleep in the UK and thankfully miss it.
I loved both games, didn’t mind not seeing barely any defence in the Chiefs vs Rams but also didn’t mind seeing the teams struggle for offence in the Super Bowl, both intense and intriguing games. Love the NFL. https://t.co/kOZCFsD9gR
Not the best game ever but win it anyway u can. 6 rings for Brady just wow. #SuperBowl #PatriotsNation https://t.co/uPcez1uqC2
Morning Folks it's 6 am on Monday Morning a well deserved, 3 points @ Leicester, The New England Patriots Won The Super Bowl, United move up to 5th in the League, 2 point's Behind Chelski! What a Great Way to start. Your Week?

Silent Stan Kroenke's Rams lose out to a Patriot's side that can now call itself as good as the #Steelers. Tied on 6 wins apiece. Got to be #StairwayToSeven next year! #SteelersNation  https://t.co/oRPqu9quqj
#GoodMondayMorning everyone. Pouring at the moment, so temps have risen &amp; Winter weather gone for now. Lots on twitter about the #SuperBowl last night, especially the 1/2 time events. Have a great day one &amp; all... https://t.co/j8r2IiIcR8
Only the Americans could call themselves World Champions in a sport that only American teams compete in! 😉😁🏈 #superbowl #SBLIII
@wee_sharrrn house much did you win then you always have a superbowl bet
@TheBostonBrit @NBAUK @Al_Horford @okcthunder @tdgarden @celtics Catching the game in town before the Superbowl https://t.co/ltKgHTCDBN
@Tim_Vickery Think I'd rather watch a Serie D game in Brazil than see the Patriots win another Super Bowl lol.
@markchapman Mark, superb presentation of the super bowl... The performance of the national anthem by Gladys Knight was amazing on TV, I can't imagine what it was like being there ... Great Job tonight thanks
#SuperBowl overnight means trailers and tv spots for #AvengersEndgame, #CaptainMarvel and #ToyStory4. Meaning I gotta watch them, meaning I'm running late to take the child to child minder, meaning I'm late for work. I'm not even sorry!
Enjoyed @tom_lutz’s report from #SuperBowlLlll: ‘Many hate the Patriots, but few can deny their brilliance’ https://t.co/DgxhE5apzq
@AldiUK Super Bowl is the answer
Disappointing collection of #SuperBowl movie trailers this morning.
*googles who won the super bowl*
Super Bowl over. Now time for all those ‘fans’ to wait another year till they watch an American football match.
Because of that shitey superbowl I'm running on 3 hours sleep and have Double English today. Fuck The Pats
Good answer, Pato. 👏👏👏 #NFFC #DCFC #DCFCFans #SuperBowl2019 https://t.co/zaykXa8ZJH
Trying to find the #SuperBowl score on my news apps and can only find reviews of Maroon 5. 
Getting their priorities right.

Chose sleep over the Super Bowl... 13-3 😴💩 didn’t miss much! Two boring teams and one boring score line #SuperBowlLIII

thank god no one in england cares about the super bowl
Always a killer getting up for work after the Super Bowl! 😴 

Tom Brady is the 🐐 #GOAT #SixRings
Immediately regretting staying up for the #SuperBowl
Watched the first 10 minutes of the super bowl. There was a flag on a play for a good tackle and no flag for a grab of the face mask how can about 20 officials get these things wrong?
How long is the @Avengers Super Bowl teaser spoiler special going to be @HelenLOHara, @ChrisHewitt ? You can draw 30 seconds to at least 45 minutes!
Not a popular opinion but Super Bowl what a load o shite 🤷🏼‍♂️🤷🏼‍♂️
I don’t understand the Super Bowl - it would never work in football. If Maroon5 came on to play some tunes at halftime in the FA Cup final everyone would be like not now lads we’re 2-1 down to Hull.
You have to admire the integrity of the #LARams throwing the #SuperBowl to avoid sharing a cold burger with @realDonaldTrump
@MasonCooper4 @Rankles75 Yeah, that’s right. They haven’t lost a Super Bowl since, erm, the previous one. #Eagles The thing about having a dominant team in the League, is that it’s great to see them toppled.
super bowl being shown in uk on bbc and yet they still manage to talk about england fitba team, what chance ye got btw🤣
💗Sexy performance of   @maroon5 at The super bowl half time show.
@adamlevine 
 💪🏻🕺🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🥰 https://t.co/RiojtAwpaz
Love seeing the #SuperBowl2019 adverts... once again @amazon have smashed it... also love @Doritos and @expensify
Have to say that was the best/worst Super Bowl I ever stayed up/ fell asleep an hour before the start in history
Reckon there s anyone @HKane didn't get a photo with at #SuperBowl ? 😂
@AdamDDickinson so glad I didn’t stay up to watch #SuperBowl. Sounds like a right snooze fest. By the sounds of it Hecker should have been MVP - and he’s a punter!!!!!!!!!!! #BoreOff
But at least we see history been made by Brady winning his sixth Super Bowl https://t.co/tvIqJ42Fmg
Ryan stayed up for the entire super bowl and now complaining he’s tired, well no shit 🤦🏽‍♀️
Patriots won the super bowl with legit defense &amp; committed run game (ran the ball on 48% of plays in the playoffs). Meanwhile we throwing the ball 50 times a game (league worst 33% of plays were runs) &amp; covering wideouts with LBs. But sure that’s just the way the league is now 🙄
I concede I had to go to my bed. Some may say it wasn’t the best Super Bowl. But if offenses aren’t performing it usually means the defenses are. Credit to both sides for that. And that drive that won it. 🤘 @Edelman11 MVP legend. #WeGotEverything #gopats #superbowl
For people who don’t usually watch the NFL don’t be put off by last nights Super Bowl . It was a terrible game and even us NFL fans were not impressed 🏈

The rams had no business being in the superbowl
Super Bowl one for the purist but defensive masterclass from Belichick #SuperBowl2019
Winner. https://t.co/klzj2Pm7xZ
On Sunday the Premier League Champions beat Arsenal....also the Media darlings Man Utd beat Leicester..so what headlines do we get on Monday morning? Superbowl , Superbowl , Superbowl. Fuck your offffence &amp; deeeefence &amp; fuck you Sky Sports.
Go Pats! Brady is the 🐐 #SuperBowl 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🏈 🏆 💍 💍💍💍💍💍
Is the Super Bowl still playing? #TouchDownWhoppers 🍔
Think I just pee’d my pants a little....eek 😬 #HandmaidsTale #wakeup #underhiseye #SuperBowl2019
Why does the UK get obsessed with the Superbowl? It's not like you follow the rest of the sport
Waking up to @Patriots as Super Bowl champions😁💙🏈 #SuperBowlLlll
This one wins, everyone else go home #SuperBowl https://t.co/5vEIdkLLus
#AvengersEndGame #SuperBowl trailer was amazing, I love that they're not giving away too much and hint that there is still hope and the Captain has his shield back!!!! 🥰 I just can't wait to see! After the heartache that Infinity war caused we need to know what's going on!!!!
Why do people watch super bowl if they don’t like it or know what’s going on?? You wouldn’t watch gay porn just because loads of others do
They need to do a super bowl with gaga, Perry, Ariana, Beyoncé and Nicki! That would be amazing
Normally I would just ignore the Superbowl and not mention it's the most tedious sport in the world, however now that it's shunted @BBCMOTD to BBC2 meaning my series link didn't work and it hasn't recorded here's a fact - the only thing worse than the Superbowl is Maroon 5 🖕🏼
@HarryPeacock3 @thomasphi Hahaha I do it every year, stay up for half the Super Bowl, moan about how bad it is, fall asleep in the second/third quarter then repeat the cycle 364 days later
So they can’t all be shootout thrillers,  and there was still a lot to unpack from the lowest scoring Super Bowl ever. Here’s my #SBLIII recap for @OmnisportNews 

https://t.co/0HGxEauuGI
Male cheerleaders at the #SuperBowl ?!? #BlameBrexit the whole world is broken
#worsthalftimeshowever #superbowl I had so many high expectations it was just boring
Quite disturbing how many news outlets are reporting “hot shirtless Adam Levine” and “Adam Levines nipples just won the superbowl” given what ya’ll did to Janet Jackson!! https://t.co/MtqRYlrTrY
That superbowl got the half time show it deserved
Congratulations to @Patriots for winning there 6 Super Bowl what an accomplishment 🤙🤙🎉🎉🎊🎊🎉🎉🎉🎉
Don’t even care about the Super Bowl 🏈 But I heard rams lost so fuck kronke #kronkeout #topcuntof2019

Stayed up for the @SuperBowl and now I’m hanging 😂 @Patriots 🏉🥇
In homage of last nights/this mornings @SuperBowl only fitting that the quote is from the great Vince Lombardi. Busy last week of the half coming up, going to be a good hometown derby on sunday @bedfordrowing Head #earnit #eagle https://t.co/amlmVaLurT

That half time though........... can I ever get those 20 minutes back 🙈🏈🤔😩 #SuperBowl2019 #Halftime #PepsiHalftime
So glad I didnt watch any of the Superbowl last night, I knew who'd win! 
Great season, besides the last three games!
Congratulations to @Patriots on their SIXTH Super Bowl

What a dynasty!!

@prozdkp I told my partner we should visit America to do this, he sadly tried to let me down so kindly and gently “that’s probably not possible, the superbowl is in the middle of the night, Disneyland probably won’t be open” 
HE FORGOT HOW TIME DIFFERENCE WORKS
Write Brady and the boys off at your peril 🏆🏈 @Patriots #Superbowl
Guessing I’m only one that couldn’t give a fuck about the Super Bowl? Rather finger my brother
So England won the #SuperBowl ?
Haha. We don't even play it over here and we beat the yanks at their own game! Get in.
The #Maroon5 halftime show was bang average. #SuperBowl

Waking up to the Patriots winning the Super Bowl once again is the best Monday news.
#GOAT
When is this super bowl drivel going to disappear off the timeline? boro fans tweeting about as if we actually give a fuck.
Woke up to see the Patriots have won. But gutted. #Superbowl
Went to bed at halftime last night and finished the game this morning. That was the most boring Super Bowl I can remember.
Super Bowl and school runs are not a good mix...taking my tired ass back to bed to dream of a world without Brady &amp; Edelman!! #MondayMotivation #SuperBowlSunday #SuperBowl53 #schoolruns #tooearly
Just think... if Dee Ford had lined up onside, we would’ve had a Chiefs vs. Rams #SuperBowl. It would’ve been 45-43 &amp; we’d all be happy #NFL
Hope my USA friends had great day for the Super Bowl. Meanwhile back here in our little village we still had snow. Looks like is going this morning. Muffin looks like my real dog we had… https://t.co/I64y1vyJk7
Waking up to the #SuperBowl result...

I’ve really got to stop doubting Brady, he’s not human. 🏈
@blockie_damo Hope the super bowl was worth the lack of sleep 😴 😂
I think I may have picked the wrong year to try and understand this sport - apparently the worst super bowl ever!  I don't know, I can't tell! 😕

@DonaldJTrumpJr Then how come Microsoft Super Bowl ad commercial win over loads of peoples hearts? Hmm
Was worried I wouldn’t have enough time on my commute to watch all the #SuperBowl highlights. 
I was wrong, oh so very wrong.
I watched the Super Bowl until half time &amp; it was the most boring thing ever; I’ll never understand American Football hype over here, shit sport!
Patriots win the superbowl... Tom Brady the G.O.A.T... Bore off 😴 😴 😴

The Super Bowl,  it's not even a proper sport.
For last year’s Super Bowl, I watched the Patriots lose to the Eagles with Philly superfan @Marcotti on Monday morning, and then went up to Watford that night to watch Chelsea lose 4-1.

Things worked out much better this year! 🏈⚽️
Typical  I stay up for the #SuperBowl and it ends up being a punt fest.
Patriots deserved to win, they know how to shut down an offense, not entertaining but effective.
Goff was badly exposed.
Next year is the #Seahawks year though I can  feel it #GoHawks
@layna It was a shite spectacle. The whole thing. #SuperBowl
Did I watch the super bowl?
No, because I’m not a child that latches into weird American culture for stay up all night to watch the most boring stop and start sport.
#SuperBowl2019 surely should be renamed the #superbore
Ffs  everyone on my TL going on about 21 savage is from the ends, how comes no 1 talking about Travis Scott falling of the stage #SuperBowl
Morning after the Super Bowl... please give us a prod mid afternoon... zzzzzz... enjoyed the last quarter #SuperBowl #bbcsuperbowl did look fab in HD
Many thanks to Tom and all the staff @TribalBarHull for a fantastic #superbowl night. Great place, good food and fantastic service 👏👏
@ToppsHuddle @obj @CameronNewton Topps you let us fans down. You released no non-cash cards in the Super Bowl and the cards for Super Bowl contests were awful in design and uninspiring. You let thousands of fans down for being greedy. You failed worse than the Rams offense. You gotta rethink how you manage SBs👎

Just woke up in London and found I slept through the most boring and pointless Super Bowl of all-time #blessed
See it's as edgy to bitch about American Football as it is to say you don't support England every tournament. Most of my timeline bitching about "fans" coming out at Super Bowl time despite only tweeting about 🏈 when the Super Bowl is on.
Is the #SuperBowl2019 #HalftimeShow worth watching?
@FrankiLoveMusic Absolutely no interest in superbowl at all
So many people saying that the #Superbowl half time show with @maroon5 was boring 🙄 at the end of the day if you’re not fans of #Maroon5 then of course you won’t enjoy it. I personally love them and thought they did great! Mixture of their hits too, what’s not to love 👏🏼❤️
Damn the pats winning the Superbowl again even got Sunny D in their feelings https://t.co/MckWnYQk5M
I watched the first "quarter" of the American soccer thing last night. Didn't understand it one bit. Flags, time outs, dropping ball.

@cpricesports worst super bowl, was colts cowboys way back when,

this one rocked in the 4th qtr
Reading through what happened at the Super Bowl last night made me glad I didn’t stay up to watch it as the wide consensus was that it was awful. Weirdly enough though a lot of it is focusing on M5’s performance among other things so I still don’t know one thing...

The result.
Last night I got invited down to watch the screening of the super bowl match at The White Rabbit in Shoreditch.

@MNFUK How about simplifying the question? Worst super bowl in history?
Who else decided to stay up for the super bowl and now can’t keep there eyes open 😴
After watching the #SuperBowl last night, I was highly disappointed to find out how un-super it was! And where was the bowl? 
And shouldn’t the #NewEnglandPatriots sing #Shipoopi when they do a touchdown? 

No I aren’t an #AmericanFootball fan, as you can tell.
@AldiUK SuperBowl
Hadn’t watched a #Superbowl for nearly 30yrs &amp;, but for the company kept &amp; #CardsAgainstHumanity, wish I hadn’t bothered last night.
The bastards Patriots won it when the officials made the bad call against the Saints 2 weeks ago
Ha llegado ya la época donde todos sois fans de la Súper bowl no?
Didn't even watch the 4th quarter, and regret watching any of if tbf. What a shite game and a shite outcome #SuperBowl
My phone autocorrects 'Superbowl' to 'Superb Owl' #ecologistproblems #nfl 🦉 🏈
People ask what motivates the patriot's to keep going... I imagine that being the most successful franchise in history will keep Brady and belicheck going! #nfl #superbowl #Patriots
Alive in the year that a Jewish man won the NFL MVP award. Take a bow Julian Edelman. New England Patriots Super bowl victors.
It think last nights Super Bowl wasn’t great all round...unentertaining game, bad half time show...thank God for the adverts to keep me entertained 😩 @Browns vs @Saints next year 🤔 #prediction
@reesgidley @shooun I’ve no problem with anything you drink mate. Each to their own tastes. Enjoy &amp; I hope the Super Bowl outcome was the 1 you wanted.
@SkySportsNFL  How on earth have you made your #SuperBowl  highlights  show last 2 hours? 😄 https://t.co/GvawS2MYlb

Fuck your super bowl b.
Okay so after last night's Superbowl I'm concerned the NFL will actually ban tackling for next season
who is tom brady and what the fuck is the superbowl
@BBCRadio2 Definitely @JACKPACK_UK 🎵🎵🎵🕺🏻🕺🏻🕺🏻🕺🏻 they would put some #Swing into any #Superbowl and draw the biggest crowd 🙌😍
@benmelvin6 They only got maroon 5 cos loads of people fucked it off over Colin kaspinacs ban from the nfl mate, so until that’s sorted expect shore acts at the Super Bowl
After an extended lie-in I have risen with the reminder of last nights game. Congratulations @Patriots for winning the SuperBowl.

I’m pursuing positivity today even though I’m salty about the football 😉😎 Have an awesome day lovely people 👍🏻💯
The worst thing about the #SuperBowl is that we’re now 7 months from the next proper NFL game
Not the best #Superbowl I’ve ever seen, and definitely not the best half-time show! Probably not worth the tiredness today, 😴 I’m going to try and make a friend in coffee ☕️
@AgathaChocolats No! you can't watch the superbowl
Watched  the Super Bowl last night for the first time in U.K.  with my husband I won’t be watching again with him smugness is not a good look on a man of a certain age https://t.co/m1zqLMuhLc
I wish to be surrounded by Pats fans next Super Bowl we are in. Preferably in Boston. Or the Super Bowl itself. Either way, I wanna be right there
Soooo this Super Bowl thing, it looks fun. When I mean people are at home eating and drinking with a wonderful live mini concert. I could totally get on this bandwagon
The morning after the #SuperBowl2019 and you open your eyes and yes #Cheatriots still won #pleasehelp
Getting up this morning seeing a lot of social media posts about the Superbowl from people who are historically not sports fans.
I've watched the #NFL for years, regular and post season. But if you haven't watched the season, what makes you stay up till 4am to criticize the game.
Nadie está hablando de la actuación de la SuperBowl, los heteros pierden otra vez.

Actually thought the Super Bowl was decent. Two superb defensive displays, a moment of magic from Gronk and the experience levels of the two QB’s telling in the end.
@OsiUmenyiora well Osi you picked the wrong team to win the Super Bowl,but man you picked right with the frozen Maltesers 👍 best half time show ever 🤣

@linda_taylor01 At one time they called it SUPERBOWL WORLD SERIES but only USA teams played for it but still boring
@RichJonesMedia Correct. You have got to applaud Tom Brady because his experience and having the ability to second guess the Rams is what won them the Super Bowl.
@KennasKingdom @TheJennTracker @thetimtracker In the U.K. the superbowl isn’t as important as @thetimtracker I think he even trumps our beloved @FACupFinal
@innesfergie1997 😂😂😂 worst super bowl in history
#Mahomes #Goff exciting young players.  But there simply is nothing to better experience.. #TomBrady #GOAT #GoPats @Patriots 
Underdogs 😂😂😂😂 #SuperBowl

@LillywhiteYid10 What a load of 💩💩#superbowl
@mlombardiNFL @tatefrazier @ringer Do you think the Patriots would have still won the Super Bowl  if Brian Hoyer was the starting QB??
Not sure how the Super Bowl could’ve been any worse. Wasn’t even about good defence for the most part, it was just terrible offensive performances and an abysmal halftime show. #jesushchrist #SuperBowlLIIII
Love Travis Scott but that super bowl performance was horrific
Absolutely brilliant coverage of #SuperBowl last night @neilreynoldsnfl @Jeff_Reinebold @BuckyBrooks @85WORLDCHAMPS @skysportsnfl was well worth taking the day off for. Until next season....
The #Superbowl did more for the NFL Boycott than any Racist President ever could. #BoringBowl don't give me that "defensive masterclass rubbish. 1 fumble the whole game that wasn't even a turnover

@ToppsHuddle Topps you let us fans down. You released no non-cash cards in the Super Bowl and the cards for Super Bowl contests were awful in design and uninspiring. You let thousands of fans down for being greedy. You failed worse than the Rams offense. You gotta rethink how to manage SBs 👎

What’s all the fuss about Maroon 5 at the Super Bowl? Didn’t we already know they were shit? I once accidentally caught them live about 15 years ago. Lead singer kept lifting his shirt to impress the girlies.
I only know Adam Levine from that Kanye tune he did with him that's good but it's pure not an album opener even though it's the first song on 'Late Registration'. 

But today I also know him as the Superbowl Max Cady for thots.

@SuperBowl @NFL
First and last time I go up the town for the superbowl, couldn’t hear a word Tony Romo was saying last night
@LuciferDonOfDe1 @AFTVMedia @JakeFCohen No investment required with the rams over what they earn. The NFL is designed to bring near equality and that any team can one day make it to the Superbowl. This happened. Totally different to requiring hundreds of millions to get arsenal near to challenging
Ok the #SuperBowl might just of happened but I’m obsessed with the #PuppyBowlXV I think the half time show was fantastic! 😍 https://t.co/ZJT9xtaaWA
@mattflory17 Definitely in the conversation... but averaging a super bowl every 3 years and having won 3 out of the last 4.. pretty dominant over an 18/19 year period.

Finally got around to downloading the BBC app, feels good to know what’s happening in the world, esp cos it’s Super Bowl Day yew
I had heard that the #SuperBowl was dull and maybe it was when watched in real time. But I just watched the highlights on YouTube and I thought as a war of attrition it was fairly entertaining.
@ReachEd I realise it's not everybody's cup of tea. I have been following the game since the mid eighties. Yesterday's superbowl wasn't a great game compared to some others.
@Hollyrope I was following the Rams too, can’t stand the Patriots or Brady. Always get refs decisions go there way. Thought it was a terrible Super Bowl tbh.
Interesting that #NationalSickieDay is the day after the #SuperBowl2019 🏈 gridiron fans must like to party 🥳 https://t.co/dzwPG9SC6C
Proud to be part of the 5% who couldnt give a flying canary about the Super Bowl. Watched 5 minutes got bored. Pile-a pish.

@1LORDARCHER @NFL @SuperBowl It's you. I fucking love it!! Watch every week. play off matches were better than any prem league match i have seen recently.action packed.just gotta learn the rules.much more tactical than football but can be really exciting mate.

Had vaguely heard of Maroon 5. But didn't realise they were big enough to do a superbowl. Are they like an American McFly or something?

Watched the recorded Super Bowl. Gripping tight game. Defences really bringing the pressure and seeing offences trying to perform within it. Interesting to see the coaches tactics. 
#SuperBowlLlll
Lots of people moaning about the standard of the #SuperBowl last night. I absolutely loved it. Doesn't have to be a score-fest. Was soooo intense. Must admit that I wanted Rams to win though. Better team won. 🏈
I’ve only just realised today that when spongebob sang at the Super Bowl he was under the dome because he’s a sponge and can’t breathe on land

@samcunningham @iPaperSport It’s quite ironic that this article uses a picture of said fortnite player at the Super Bowl which was in from 11PM-3AM. I wouldn’t mind if football had to change its primary goal of making cash and started looking after the fans that are currently there!

I don't get why English people hype about the Superbowl I didn't even know there was that many new England fans on my timeline but ask them to name 3 plays without Brady or gronk

@jasongay I can’t even remember the final score but wasn’t Super Bowl 50 pretty awful too? Von Miller terrorised Cam Newton and Manning by that stage might as well been throwing a cannonball. It was hardly an offensive master class either

@michaelis4real @WiseOne719 Only way I see us not getting to the SUPERBOWL is injuries and not giving Brady receivers who can get open. We got a lot of dead weight on the offensive side of the ball

@DanHanzus I have to be honest here. Getting so fed up with the whole Patriots winning super bowl. I will admit they have a great HC and a brilliant QB. But it’s getting boring now. Would have loved to see chiefs play rams. Oh well on to next season.  #patriotsdownfall
@DanHanzus @ChrisWesseling @MarcSesslerNFL @greggrosenthal off the back of a meh Super Bowl (for some) may I reccomend some @SixNationsRugby fantastic intensity and some “proper” defensive play!(Defending in rugby speak) ireland vs Scotland should be the game of the week! Enjoy!

Poésie 101 par Frank

Le Super Bowl 52
Avec une gang de tripeux

Organisé par notre ami JC
Ce sera un méchant party

Qui remportera ce duel
Qui aura les bras vers le ciel

Les Eagles ou les Patriots
Le jour de la marmotte

Un héros ce Tom Brady
À l'instar de Big Papi

Tom Brady (AKA The 🐐) becomes the oldest MVP in NFL History at 40.

@haylie_brass 100% agree.Think most sports are like this. People only watch the final as a excuse to party. I've never seen a Superbowl or a football game at that. Just like most holidays you shouldn't need a excuse to drink and get Shit faced. If your going to do it, do it. ps I don't 🍻👍😁
#SuperBowl is a day to remember Champion QBs like Trent Dilfer, Brad Johnson, Doug Williams &amp; Jeff Hostetler. I hope we can add Nick Foles to that list.

Define the word ‘best’. Winningest, most playoff wins, most super bowl wins which are team successes or individual stats like passing %, completions TD’s yards gained per pass QB ratings etc. If it’s the former he’s the greatest, if it’s the latter, top tier but not the greatest. https://t.co/7WVcLNYK8b

I’m excited for homemade wings and not home-made other snacks later today. The best part of Super Bowl Sunday, in my humble opinion, is the snacking potential.

Asked @WhiskeyDiez who he was cheering for in the Super Bowl, given that he's a Cowboys fan (Eagles divisional rival) who also hates the Patriots.

And I quote:

"I am rooting for the arrival of the sweet meteor of death right before kickoff."
I respect all the love for the #SuperBowl but seriously if #ThisIsUs is delayed even a minute I’m going to start hyperventilating and then I’m going to cry and then I’m going to faint and miss it anyway. 
Please football gods don’t make this my Sunday night.

What a touchdown #SuperBowl
@_JordanIAm I disagree that the Super bowl ruined Janet Jackson career. She recovered from the controversy. Janet recent North American tour earned $33 million dollars. Janet survived the Super Bowl. Her career is back on track.
Foles is definitely better than several starters were this year. #superbowl
I will admit, yes I am bandwagoning right now. But I hate Pats, so any team that faces them, I cheer for. So fuck yeah Eagles!!! #SuperBowl
This game though. This is how you want a #SuperBowl game to be! High energy through and through!
People (and @startrek) are tweeting info (verging on spoilers) from tonight's #StarTrekDiscovery so I have to stop watching #SuperBowl and watch @startrekcbs before it gets ruined for me. Turns out a PVR isnt that personal when you let people into your home through @TwitterCanada
#Eagles aren't backing down #SuperBowl
Basically our Nuns are devided by #Patsfans and those who are rooting for the #underdog.

What would make this super bowl better if like there was a surprise trailer for a new season of The Office but like...
Super Bowl commercials on the Canadian broadcast are pretty fun, even more fun would be if the CRTC could get Canadians competitive internet and phone plans.

Video review is ruining pro sports. In what era is that not a touchdown? Baseball, Hockey and Football. Give it back to the refs. Brutal. @TroyWestwood @hustlerama @RickRalphTSN @NBCSports @NFL @SuperBowl

OMFG. He had possession before crossing the goaline, the ball crosses the goalline, it's a F@#%ING touchdown. STOP.😠 | #SuperBowl
I don't even try to guess what's a catch or not in the #NFL anymore #SuperBowl #GoPats

It’s really annoying that they have to debate this is a catch. He had possession, it broke the plane..... but...... #SuperBowl
It’s clearly a touchdown! C’mon! #SuperBowl #FlyEaglesFly 🦅🏈

The Patriots make me wanna puke. #SuperBowl  Go #Eagles
The Pats must think this is the CFL cause their Defence is not showing up to stop the 3rd down conversions. #SuperBowl
I bet Kurt Warner didn't expect Tom Brady to play like this in #SuperBowl XXXVI either.
Who ever wins the Super Bowl, only the offensive personal should get rings. #SBLII

@Kellygirl300 Yeah I do, because Prince said so in his own words. He didn’t believe in performing with the dead. A tribute would have been lighting the city up purple, with a video of his Super Bowl performance or image. JT performed with a track and projection, which goes against his wishes.

- Justin Timberlake is a glory hog who wont give the guys who got him there  a bone. 2/10 show
- Having to share the Brady Beaters spotlight with Nick Foles is gonna take getting used to
- Doug Pedersen is a degen
I see by the  @SuperBowl ads that @Buick @BuickCanada is pushing the new Enclave. If you have a trade in get it in writing, oops, that doesn't matter the figures will change anyway. @selkirkgm @ThisIsGMC @GM @GMcanada @Buick #GMsucks #GMneveragain

By far the best #SuperBowl I’ve ever seen. No matter if the opposition comes back from 28-3 down, to see two big time offences go blow for blow was beautiful. @NFL did it right on this night.
97% Chance Cris Collingsworth and the head referee are currently consoling Brady’s wife in the VIP box #SuperBowl #Eagles
I can't emphasize this enough; if you believe your "God" or "Lord" can impact the score of the Super Bowl, you're worshiping a loan shark!! #SuperBowlLll #prayer
Watching the superbowl with the boys was fun but nothing will ever compare to the night I had watching the game with you last year
It’d be cool if Michelle Williams had made a big #SuperBowl bet on the #Eagles and then donated the winnings in Mark Wahlberg’s name to a charity he’d hate.

What I learned from today’s #SuperBowl: @NFoles_9 is better than Tom Brady...                                            ...at catching the football 🏈
tell twitter about that time you watched the cowboys win a super bowl 23 years ago.. oh you’re 22 https://t.co/Up5gbC4wYo
the best story in football this season is Bud Light giving free beer to all of Philadelphia for winning #SuperBowl
#SuperBowl in amazing #whitehorse https://t.co/Tu4QLCB1vz
First Super Bowl I got @katty_kang to watch completely with me. Game was amazing!
Kevin Hart Lol! #SuperBowl
Watching Brady's press conference.  I think I threw up in my mouth a little.  #SuperBowl

Congrats to Lisa for winning a mini fridge AND congrats to the Eagles for winning the #SuperBowl!! @BWWings @Catontheradio @CraigRossRock95 https://t.co/vP7VMEGexS
Someone tell Glenn Howerton he has to come back to It's Always Sunny for the Gang Wins The Superbowl episode.
@JeanBottari Il devait écouter le Super Bowl, il va se reprendre
Happy day for @Eagles #SuperBowl champions
Brady loses 3rd SuperBowl will not ever tie Jim Kelly at 4 because he will NEVER be back

The only player the #Eagles should send to the White House is Chris Long, let him boo throughout Trump’s remarks and hand him a #45 IMPEACH jersey. #SuperBowl
@LeahRemini We didn’t get any Super Bowl commercials here. They must not like Canadians lol

I asked my girl if she is into a Super Bowl plan and she came back with this huge
 glass of wine ... so movie, #netflix and some Rioja red wine for us https://t.co/t1hu5RVx9e
Not even @Eagles fan but so happy they win #SuperBowl #NoMorePats #GangGreen
Watching #superbowl and it’s over and #ThisIsUs cuts in and I haven’t seen this season!! And now I’m ruined.
Who fucking cares about This is Us...its Super Bowl FFS! Does it have to aire tonight? 🙄🙄
I enjoyed watching the Super Bowl and all but you know what’s better than it.... the Stanley Cup finals
If you are in Philadelphia: Broad St CLOSED due to Super Bowl victory celebrations. Avoid area.
The only way the #Eagles beat the #Pats, is if they take gutsy chances. That’s what they did. #NFL #SuperBowl ad
So who lost a pile of money today, hmmm? #SuperBowl #SuperBowlLll
Taking solace of the @Patriots loss in the fact that I own a @HyundaiCanada car, and that according to the #SuperBowl commercial, that's a good thing. #Genesis #Hyundai
@Angie_Harmon @Eagles @SuperBowl @superbowl50 I don't know about you Angie, but I was  sitting on the edge of my seat for the Eagles. 👍🏻😘
Was it just me or was that @KevinHart4real trying to scam his way onto the #SuperBowl stage like my buddy Brad who vomits on himself and can't understand why the bartender cut him off?
2018 @SuperBowl 🏈 party  at 505.  Three of my grandson's and their buds enjoyed a total of 75 points and over 1000 yards of offence in an old fashion shoot out. #SuperBowl https://t.co/Nf9D3M8dj9
If you are drinking after Super Bowl Eagles victory, DO NOT DRIVE. Extra “RIDE” police patrols on all roads in Greater Toronto Area.
I get a lot of “Well aren’t you rooting for SC alum ____ (on team opposing Pats) in the Super Bowl?”

No. Literally never. I’m 100% more a New Englander than I will ever be a USC fanatic (although I’m an alum).

Well played, Agholor. But I’d have rather seen you drop every pass.
Now that the #SuperBowl is over, read this, if you haven't.  It's true storytelling at it's finest and most-heartbreaking https://t.co/KgdQ4d23ni
Shout out to all those people who spent money for a big super bowl party thinking your team would win and your team lost. 😂 I been there before waste of money.

Big props to the #Eagles - they went all in from the first play. #SuperBowl
Let's make this clear, the #Eagles are the team of the working class. The #Pats have a Trump supporting quarterback who is against the kneeling protests.

Nothing like watching the #SuperBowl and seeing my friend @The_DannyMac (in a creepy turtleneck) pop up on the screen. 😍 https://t.co/KjCHAxbTGG
Total yards: Patriots 613, Eagles 538. This was a seriously amazing Superbowl and the reign of Brady is over.
@RachealBlaze I guess ur team didn't win the SuperBowl it was a awesome game though 😁👍👌

Can you be world champions if every team in the league is from the same country? Asking for a friend. #SuperBowl
Hey @NFL - congrats on a fantastic, beautifully-executed Super Bowl game! Just one thing though - I swear to heck if someone calls the Super Bowl the “world championships” of football ONE MORE TIME... #ohCanada @CFL @GreyCupFestival #umm
It’s a tough loss when Tom Brady throws for over 500 yards..but the Pats D plays like crap WELP.  Congrats Eagles, I guess 😭🏈 #SuperBowl
I’ll never understand why they say they’re “world champions” after winning the super bowl
10 years ago my Mom watched her last Super Bowl-with her NY Giants beating the Patriots, how sweet to watch the Eagles do the same tonight!!
Me acabo de enterar que “Super Bowl” no es el nombre del estadio donde se juega la final. Siempre creí - como la Bombonera - que era una cancha con forma de “Súper Tazón”.
Where does Super Bowl MVP Nick Foles end up next season?? Broncos? Jets? Browns? Cardinals? Eagles? #SBLII
You know who I’m happy for about the #PhiladelphiaEagles #SuperBowl win? This dude. #phillyphil https://t.co/l7OC7I74Zm

Why do they call the winner of the #SuperBowl “World Champions”? 🤔
NFL Super Bowl: I always cheer for the underdog so yah Eagles! JT was meh 😕 and the US Bank Stadium looks incredible. Always a good excuse to drink beer on a Sunday. #SuperBowl2018
Only in America does a team playing a league that’s only in America call itself world champion. @SuperBowl

Thoughts on #SuperBowl:

1. What kind of commercials were those? Was I watching the Canadian broadcast?
2. Tide x Old Spice Guy = best commercial. 
3. What is with those QB graphics with the stats? It’s 2018, not Madden 07...
4. Nick Foles bout to get paid!!!
5. GREAT GAME!!!
This is sort of karma for the 283 diamonds on last year’s Superbowl ring. This is a good day for fans of football

I'm throwing up the #PrayForPhiladelphia hash tag early . That city is gonna be rubble by tomorrow #SuperBowl
Tom Brady threw for 505 yards, just 49 yards short of the all time Super Bowl record... his final incomplete pass was 50 yards. Missed it by just that much... Hell of a game!!! @NFL #superbowl #lii #TomBrady
Quick question: Are you happy for the eagles or happy the Patriots lost? #SuperBowl

Funny how the Philadelphia Eagles are regarded as "world champions", for a sport that's mainly played in the US.  Illusions of grandeur.  #SuperBowl
What team would lose their Starting Quarterback , Starting Middle Linebacker, Starting Left Tackle , Best Special teams players and still win the SuperBowl ?!?!??! Im wearing my EAGLES JERSEY ALL WEEEK!

See that’s why they gave MVP to Brady so Eagles would win the Super Bowl
@MikeReiss To change up the D just before #SuperBowl is sketchy.   The #Eagles smartly went after Rowe like rabid dogs.

@TMobile AWESOME ad on #SuperBowl today! Please continue to be so respectful to all. Way to go! Trump supporters F U.
My one take on the Super Bowl: Doug Pederson. To guide this Eagles team to the title without his MVP candidate QB, the starting left tackle and his best linebacker is quite an accomplishment. Gameplan and use of analytics were off the charts. Fascinating story.

Keep it real: If a backup quarterback leads ur team to the SuperBowl and dominated and looked like a damn starter... Would u give him up? #Eagles are in a tough spot. Would yall take Tyrod and 4th 😁?

Flyers owner passes away, they hand out commemorative bracelets at a playoff game. Fans throw them on the ice. 

Stay classy, Philly 😂

Here we go, watching the Super Bowl episode of This Is Us. Everyone wish me luck.
2 final Super Bowl takeaways.
1.Tom Brady is still the greatest QB ever. 
2. Bill Belichick legacy takes a hit. How do you not play one of your best defensive players in a Championship game?

#SuperBowl #FlyEaglesFly #GoPats
TB12: 40 years old, 2018 NFL MVP, 5 rings, 5 SuperBowl 4th quarter game-winning drives (would've been the 6th last night if his Defense could make a stop), 500+ passing yards last night (NFL playoff record), 8 AFC Championships
No ones really talking about how Kevin Hart tried to storm the super bowl stage after the game but got heavily denied by security🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️😂😩 even when he’s not trying he is HILARIOUS!!

Cripes, Morris Day and The Time would’ve done a better job at the #SuperBowl with just their two hits (or was it one?) - that, plus Prince’s protégés (Sheila E, etc) would’ve actually been amazing and an awesome tribute to the Prince of RnB and the city of Minneapolis. #RIPPrince
Beyoncé makes Super Bowl show look effortless. Timberlake reminded us just how tough it really is to perform on that spectacular stage. Not into Beyoncé these days but @NFL should make her a permanent fixture at halftime - they’re prolly worried she’d make it political again...

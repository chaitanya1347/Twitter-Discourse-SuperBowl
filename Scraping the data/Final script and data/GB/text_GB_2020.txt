I’ll be honest, with the Falcons being largely awful this season and with the A’s and LFC being magnificent whilst the NFL season was on, it’s largely passed me by this year. But very excited about this Super Bowl. Could be superb!

Who’s gonna win tonight? #SuperBowl2020 #SuperBowl #SuperBowlSunday
It’s been a brilliant weekend at @edwellbeingfest seeing so many inspiring authors, including super-wise @ProfDavidNutt and beautiful yoga with @mind_body_bowl - a well-needed respite from January, seeing how much difference individuals really CAN make, despite how it can feel... https://t.co/ZQNQ3jrHX2
This is who you need to get for the headliner @PrideBrighton https://t.co/pelXN4zmgQ
Yes I will be staying up to watch the SuperBowl Halftime. Yes it is partly for JLo and Shakira and partly for the 49ers cause SF forever.
Lol I just remembered I'm co-hosting a superbowl party with Lawrence tonight. 😭

We always go again!
@RBanwell @Jeff_Reinebold @NFL @SuperBowl @SkySportsNFL @Oddschecker 35-17 Chiefs!

@Covers_Vegas Indeed! We have slightly different Super Bowl Sunday traditions! Game time is 11:35pm local here!
2020 Superbowl strategy. Haven’t got the caffeine yet. No power nap. Just a big meal super-late, constant snacking. Then hit the caffeine hard at game time.

Let’s see how work is tomorrow. No overtime please
I understand American football and as a kid used to watch it with my dad but I’ve never watched a #SuperBowl. I feel like it’s something I should do. #SuperBowl2020 #englishman
Anyone wanting an inside insight to the Super Bowl give a follow to my pal @NatCoombs who is the UK TV presenter across the pond for the action later this evening 🏈🏈🎤🎤 Good Luck Nat, it’s work pal honestly🎤😜🇺🇸

@who_the_fox I’ve only just found out that the Super Bowl lasts for an average of almost 4 hours!
Also, that they swap out the entire team depending which way they’re running instead of having people that can both defend and run &amp; catch on the team. 
The whole thing seems mental.
Almost time!!!! #SuperBowl #RomanReigns #SashaBanks https://t.co/SA2XNn28By

Why can’t the Super Bowl be on a Saturday night - or during a holiday?! Bleary eyes tomorrow! 🏈

The #SuperBowl #MVP has been awarded annually since the game's inception in 1967. Through 1989, the award was presented by SPORT magazine. Bart Starr was the MVP of the first two Super Bowls.

Tom Brady is the only player to have won four Super Bowl MVP awards. https://t.co/JqPfoOy10i
Hey @paddypower, looking Super Bowl odds. Let’s get this ahead of time, unlike the last time.

49ers to win, 49ers to get more than 5 sacks and keep KC under 30 points.

Hit me.
For the last 6 years I have listened to the @AroundTheNFL podcast &amp; always looked forward to their Super Bowl recap show🎙

Just wanted to thank @greggrosenthal @MarcSessler @ChrisWesseling @DanHanzus

Feel a bit like one of the part timers I normally criticise preparing to watch the Super Bowl tonight. After the first few (abysmal) Giants games I’ve barely seen much NFL action this year at all...
Hearing reports that, once again, I have not been shortlisted for this year’s Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award. 
#TheirLoss
Moment of silence for Kobe, gianna and everyone lost in the helicopter crash. That was great by the NFL. #SuperBowlLIV #SuperBowl
Getting ready for the #SuperBowl I can’t decide which way it’s going to go, hopefully both teams go for it from the start and it’s a classic
Almost #SuperBowl time! Feels strange watching it a a neutral!
My super bowl bets are usually dependent on the coin toss bet. Tails for Wales never fails!
Nearly time for the #SuperBowl Not sure I’ll make it to the end 🥱...but hopefully the #49ers will finally make it number 6 after 25yrs 🙌 #SuperBowl2020 #bbcnfl

The Price For A Once In A Lifetime (some attend yearly) 

Super Bowl I: Average ticket price was $12.00 and would stay this price until Super Bowl 4.

The fact that the first weekend of the Six Nations coincides with the Super Bowl is one of the most underrated recurring coincidences in the world.

@steve_d24 Another anagram of Super Bowl is .. “ it’s a crock of shite “ .. spelling was never my strong point 🤡
Going to be a quality Superbowl! I reckon it’s going to be a high scoring affair! But Iam going for the 49ers to win it!! #SuperBowl2020 #SuperBowlLIV @SkySportsNFL @neilreynoldsnfl

Here we go!!!! #SuperBowl 🏈 @NFLUK @NFL
@Chris_Ransom Same shit every year. I love to hear your opinion that you don’t care about the super bowl and American football is shit once a year. Just RT your own tweets from a year ago 😴😂
Happy super bowl day 🎊🎉🥳🏈🏈🏈
Tonight’s halftime #SuperBowl halftime performance is going to be EPIC! So can’t wait to see what our Latino princesses @JLo &amp; @shakira are going to perform!!! They should have at least half an hour each!!!

Normally I’d try and stay up for the Super Bowl but having a normal job now I can’t just sneak off to do some “personal admin” at 11am when I’m shattered.
Superbowl time! #SuperBowlLIV #SuperBowl @NFLUK https://t.co/k36OUDGe4o
@_binbag idk but he's flicking his ear rn. might be predicting the superbowl result
To those staying up late to watch the Super Bowl, I salute you. 🏈

This years Super Bowl is the equivalent of watching an Arsenal v Chelsea CL final. I’m trying to work out who I dislike the most. I think I’d prefer the 49ers to win #RaiderNation #SuperBowlLIV
What's for dinner on #SuperBowl Sunday? It can only be #Buffalowings with original @AnchorBarWings sauce brought back from my trip to the US.  Thanks @FifteenSpatulas for the recipe for the wings and the blue cheese dip. https://t.co/qrgOqyvKKO

Really wanna see j lo do her thing at Super Bowl half time but I have a bruised achy jaw and am probly more likely to fall asleep but It’s on record I’m deffo awake for Demi to sing the national anthem
#SuperBowl prediction,  I'm thinking the #ChiefsKingdom by a Mahomes miracle,  but to be honest I'm just gonna enjoy this game, I'm so excited for it. I think its going to be a classic.
Liverpool top and 49ers in the Super Bowl....welcome back to the 80’s 🏈 #SBLIV
So apparently pigs in blankets is a SuperBowl snack and this has made me extremely happy

I'm having a Superbowl party.  On my own.  The cats might join me, but I doubt it #superbowl
If Shakira and J-Lo can do half as amazing a performance as this, they will have done a very decent job. Nothing can be worse than last years effort from Maroon 5 that’s for certain

Michael Jackson - Super Bowl (Complete Version) (HQ) https://t.co/sfDttASkja via @YouTube
In an NFL game, as many as 75 minutes, or about 60% of total TV air time (excluding commercials), is spent on shots of players standing on the line of scrimmage, huddling, or just walking around between snaps.

With it being super bowl Sunday I’d like to take a moment to remember my youth and @Owers9 Super Bowl parties. Fucking class they were
Imagine a 4 hour Wrexham match with Gary blondie as the half time entertainment #superbowl
Who’s winning the super bowl tonight?
It’s @SuperBowl @NFL @NFLUK time! 🏈
Who you got @JamesConstable9 @AlasdairLane? #SuperBowl #chiefs #niners
You had one job @NFL... #GamePass going down across the UK on the biggest night in sport is not good. #SuperBowl https://t.co/Dg1aC1BsMj
It’s midnight in the UK so won’t be watching the Super Bowl...but..... LETS GO @49ers!!! #SuperBowlLIV
Great to see David Crosby resurrecting his career as head coach of the Kansas City Chiefs !! #wwfc #SuperBowlnaESPN #AlmostCutMyHair

Tight start to the @SuperBowl! @NFL @NFLUK #StillAwake
Instead of super bowl commercials here in the UK, they have 4 Brits giving their opinion on what’s going on.
Everyone’s watching #SuperBowl but I’m catching up on the #HAMCEL game on @btsport. COYBIG. ☘️💚👍🏻
Demi Lovato KILLED it 🙌 #superbowl #DemiLovato
Deebo Samuel getting going early in his first Super Bowl. Couple of trick plays end up in in a FG. 3-0 Niners. #SBLIV
Can’t watch BBC - they’re explaining what play action is. Saw my first live game in 1983 (Vikings v Cardinals at Wembley). I’m beyond that. Back with @SkySportsNFL #superbowl
There's a lot of red and gold on the tele. #Superbowl

@vafsearle @SuperBowl Yes
Anyone else wish here in the UK we could also watch the #Superbowl adverts as well?

Like as a part of the whole #bbcnfl programme!

I know it's not possible, it's just they are always so talked about that I'd like to them live too 😁
Am I the only #sport fan in the #UK 🇬🇧to be left cold by #SuperBowl and #NFL in general? Who outside the #US 🇺🇸 can get excited about a ‘sport’ contested exclusively by American teams, which demonstrates #American #exceptionalism so comprehensively?
The worst part of watching the super bowl overseas isn’t the time difference, but the fact that we miss out on the commercials every time 💔
What the fuck lol @NFLUK gamepass goes down 2 mins into the Superbowl. Your shit system caused me to miss two weeks of the playoffs and now the superbowl. I'll take my refund now please.
Folks, let’s remember what’s really important about this Superbowl, the Patriots aren’t in it. #SuperBowlLIV

I’ve watched 8 minutes of the Super Bowl and I can confirm this is not a sport I’m going to enjoy. Bed time.
The Super Bowl is great an all, but it would be even better if I understood the rules. #SuperBowlLIV
Was just thinking about how there’s no (to my knowledge) know cheating racists out in the SuperBowl for the first time in a while due to the lack of the patriots. But then I remembered Nick Bosa exists
@GridironGents What a joke the NFL is. Gamepass keeps doing it, but in Superbowl Sunday. Is just a moment of WOW!!!
I booked a table for here but it's not that busy. Which probably explains why I was able to hear someone here shout "Come on you reds"

#SuperBowl #SBLIV
@Jeff_Reinebold @NFL @SuperBowl @SkySportsNFL @Oddschecker 49ers by 3

Big fan of Bashaud Breeland. Shame Green Bay didn't get a healthy version of him. #SuperBowl
I’d give anything for @Titans to be in the Super Bowl 😥
@OllieConnolly @NFLUK You're having a mere the Superbowl!
Super bowl time come on the 49ers
Man, the live play lines are really inaccurate today #SuperBowl
First year I’ve not had to relearn how American football works before watching the Super Bowl 🥳
Nice one. #GamePass goes down at the start of the biggest game of the season. #SuperBowl
Almost forgot about #SuperBowlnaESPN @SuperBowl
Why have they changed the score display for the SuperBowl? It’s really annoying me
Oh #GamePass, it’s just the Super Bowl.

#SuperBowl

Well, my gut feeling before the game was 49ers. They'll definitely win now🏈
@Matt_Saddler That's why I've just stuck it on BBC. Sky and gamepass always seems to fuck up during the superbowl
Yeah 49ers are a problem. Mahomes masterclass needed. #Superbowl

Yearly routine of settling to watch the #SuperBowl... one year I will make it all the way through without having to watch again the next day 🤣
After watching @BallersHBO Season 5 Episode 8 Finale it feels like the @SuperBowl is the next episode. After @TheRock bought the @Chiefs #nfl #SuperBowl #SanFrancisco49ers #KansasCityChiefs
The Americans know how to show respect to the people who have served in the forces properly. We should take a leaf out their book treat ours like the heroes they are in the UK #SuperBowl #SBLIV
@BBCTwo super bowl build up on BBC2? Well that would have been nice to know about before hand.
49ers for me! #SuperBowl
@BBCSport why is superbowl live desk missing the e?

The pomp and ceremony and Military  fanfare of America at the Super Bowl is both disgusting and shameful! America still basking in past glories of WW2 when it is a dysfunctional democracy with a corrupt POTUS who will get away with the abuse of power!

Anyone from this part of the Atlantic remember when the @FA tried to make the FA cup final like this an @TinieTempah performed before the game. That wasn't a good look #SuperBowl
Mahomes bout to show out and get that ring #SuperBowl
Why do @SkySportsNFL come up with a new panelist for the superbowl- even if they played in one. Keep the regular panel we’ve had all year. This guy is just annoying. Might have to watch BBC...😑
@JTMitchell16 Niners!!!! #SuperBowl
Was American football played in the past with just the team on the field and a few substitutes like football or rugby? #bbcnfl #SuperBowl
Super Bowl baby! 🇺🇸🏈🏆 I am going with the Chiefs! #SuperBowl2020 #SuperBowlLIV
I reckon 1917 will probably win the Super Bowl too.
Still gutted that Ravens didn’t make the Super Bowl after the season they had. But I’m hoping it’s a good final nonetheless. Can’t help but watch and wish that the FA Cup final had a similar vibe to it. #SuperBowl
So this #SuperBowl thing, it’s like rugby but bad? https://t.co/vbZJaeyYJp

There's probably going to be lots of tweets about a superb owl tonight.
Why does my spell checker do that!
#superbowl https://t.co/LikclmpMER
Let's just enjoy this. We'll have to wait over 200 days for competitive football after tonight. #SuperBowl
Waiting for my @JustEatUK order to turn up while I have @BBCOne’s coverage of the @SuperBowl 2020 from #Miami on. Still how the #Yanks across the pond call a sport with an oval shaped ball a football. #SuperBowl
This feels weird. 
I’m a 49ers supporter of 35 years but I think I want the Chiefs to win. It means more for them for Andy Reid &amp; for the start of the Mahomes legacy. 

I know you’ll say I’m not a proper fan then &amp; I suppose that’s why it’s weird but it’s how I feel #SuperBowl
Get the junk food ready lads my annual night of watching a full game of a sport I don't understand is here #SuperBowl
Let's go Chiefs #NFL100 #SuperBowl
@Jeff_Reinebold @SuperBowl @SkySportsNFL That is quite the suit!
Come on Everton #SuperBowl
Anyone feel this Super Bowl is reminiscent of the first Giants v Patriots super bowl. Juggernaut offensive v a dominant D-Line. If the #Chiefs get an early lead could be over early, if the #fortyniners take a lead this could go to the wire. #SuperBowl #SBLIV #SFvsKC #NFL100
Not saying I watch too much wrestling, but I'm still convinced they've booked Roman Reigns to win the #SuperBowl
#SuperBowl #BBCNFL  @BBCSport    @markchapman @JasonBell33 &amp; Osi   Thank you for the fun, games &amp; expert analysis during the season 👍👏👏 Let's hope we get a classic tonight. 🇬🇧 🏈 https://t.co/dvZ5EOuwuT
Super Bowl is worse than the six nations 😂 atleast people watch 5 games of rugby a year 🙈 “I love NFL” 😴😴 #OneGameOnly #SuperBowl
Take a shot for every member of the military you see at the SuperBowl. Drunk before the end of the first quarter
Chinese n superbowl, fall asleep during fourth quarter n wake up none the wiser.
Every year I try to watch the #SuperBowl but I never have a clue what’s going on 🤷🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️
My predo: 49ers 19, Chiefs 13. D’s win out... #SuperBowl
I don't follow American football,  too much a fan of real football,  played with a round ball... and feet!

But I hope the 49ers win the Super Bowl, because I've been there and love San Fran!

#Superbowl greatest show on earth, Chiefs will win, hope it’s a good game
Super bowl? Rather watch highlights of the Burnley game
Wow #DemiLovato  what an incredible voice I don’t know when the hairs on the back of my neck will stop standing up. Beautiful inside and out.. #SuperBowlnaESPN
I just want a better game to make up for how turgid last year's was.

Superbowl LIV is on fire! Josh Norman is awesome! Sign him up for commentary! #GoChiefs #ChiefsKingdom
#SuperBowl would be so much better if they rock up, teams come out, they kick off and they get on with it. Do away with the pantoamime. #GoNiners #bbcnfl
Any freelance friends interested in the #SuperBowl? I’m on @BBCRadio2 throughout the game as their Super Bowl correspondent. 

Tune in to hear about the game, my snacks, and see if I stay awake 😰

Now to inhale some coffee ☕️
It’s time @49ers. Lets crown our season and achieve our destiny. #SuperBowlLIV #SuperBowl
Chiefs fans sounding unreal already at the #SuperBowl
Somthing seriously magical about #StarSpangledBanner American Nation Anthem. @ddlovato 👏👏👏 #SuperBowl

Looking forward to a great #SuperBowl! Come on @Chiefs #bbcnfl

Watching the Superbowl 10 seconds of action followed by 5 minutes of Studio pundits talking 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️ #whatsthepoint
Waiting for Shakira. Give us everything queen! @shakira ♥️ #SuperBowl
Watching the #SuperBowl and thinking #Rugby guys are definitely tougher and better conditioned 👍
If KC win the SuperBowl, will Mahomes be regarded as the best player ever after 3 seasons? #bbcnfl
Watching Eric Bieniemy and Kyle Shanahan call run plays on 2nd and 10 makes me feel like Pete Carroll aint all that bad 

#SuperBowl
Interesting first half of this year's #SuperBowl
After initially enjoying the fox graphics, I keep reading the play clock as the game clock and it's annoying the hell out of me #SuperBowl
Decent game so far! Currently 10-10. I think @Chiefs will win.   @PatrickMahomes, @cheetah, @JimmyG_10,  @RSherman_25 could all get the MVP. I think @Chiefs will win but it's a close one 🤷🏽‍♂️ #SuperBowl #SuperBowlLIV #NFL #NFL100 #49ers  #KansasCityChiefs 🏟🏈🏆🇺🇸 https://t.co/UBXyNpvan8

Right Jimmy finish the half strong #SuperBowl #SFvsKC
Wish we could witness the absolute chaos and panic that no doubt unfolds backstage at the #Superbowl during the final two minutes of the first half
I think Trubisky could win 3 #SuperBowl with the bears and the media still would say ‘Bears could of got Mahomes but they traded up and got Trubisky’
I hate missing the #US Ads #SuperBowl 😩😩😩
for years I tried to watch the #SuperBowl, and every year I found it impossible to understand. Eventually I gave up.

It's weird watching the #SuperBowl on the BBC and simultaneously following along on Twitter, because everyone's talking about ads that aren't broadcast over here and not much about the actual game.
Feel like this first half has gone way quicker than usual #SuperBowl
#bbcnfl the 49's defence is going to rule... #SuperBowl
@themiltonjones When do The Rangers get a penalty in the #SuperBowlLIV   @beckamillar  and when does VAR say that @LFC are deducted points for watching #SuperBowl ??
#SuperBowl w/ the boys https://t.co/EHzUykuWwJ
Here in the UK between plays we’re watching commentators discuss the game but in the US it just seems like you guys get to watch...ads?? 😅#SuperBowl
Horrific overlap in options here. Poorly designed. Apologies to those who think they'd get bang on 1, 20, or 50 #SuperBowl https://t.co/WgWaGEKuI0
I think as a rugby fan, I’ll never get the super bowl? I’m finding this SO BORING
@YaOnlyLivvOnce @NFL @NFLonFOX Are you enjoying your own SuperBowl @YaOnlyLivvOnce?
Do all American adverts have super famous people in them or is it just bc it’s the #SuperBowl ??

If @pitbull, Mr World Wide, doesn't get screen time on the #PepsiHalftime show at #SuperBowl, will be sad.
One of the really great things about NFL is the complete lack of dissent towards the officials from the players. So many sports could learn a thing or two. #SuperBowl

How many times would you successfully tackle any of the 49ers running backs if you had 100 attempts, one on one, in a 10 yard wide channel? #SuperBowl
Commentary and punditry is so much better for the NFL than it is for football. #SuperBowl
#bbcnfl here comes the heat c'mon the 49's #SuperBowl
Got work tomorrow but that won’t stop me watching the #SuperBowl ✌🏻 #49ers
Outstanding drive from the Niners there. Game could have got out of hand quickly if they didn’t get points there. Everyone at this party is complaining that it’s a boring game but I’m captivated #SuperBowl

Feel like if Jimmy G scores a TD he should flip the ball like TA7 flips his bat then rip his jersey and show a tee saying CUBS SUCK #SuperBowl
What a Super Bowl we’ve got on our hands! 
Both 9ers and Chiefs have come out to play 👀
Nice little change of pace from last year 😂
#SuperBowlLIV #49ersvschiefs
Is #SuperBowl actually good?? I mean it’s pretty fast, but does the ball even get grounded on a touchdown?! And it stops so much! At least no ads on BBC!

Promising start from the Chiefs! 👊🏻 #SuperBowl #ChiefsKingdom

@phsports1 Usually the Away team wears a white shirt. Home team wear their colours. In the Super bowl though the home team can decide what they want to wear. Home/away team alternates each year between NFC and AFC. This year is AFC.

Chiefs not turned up here. Kelce, Hill, Mahomes all anonymous. Masterclass from the Niners #SuperBowl
Are we going to see a Fullback get SuperBowl MVP #SuperBowl #SBLIV

MOSTERT!!! #SuperBowl
GET IN!!! #GoNiners #SuperBowl
#bbcnfl 49ers will win. The Simpson predicted they would win the superbowl in Miami back in the 90s. Another Simpsons prediction
Touchdown #Niners #SuperBowl
@JuiceCheck44 for MVP. #SuperBowl #bbcnfl

Defence wins championships 💪🏻

Boy-Genius Mahomes looking rattled 🤫🤫

#SuperBowl
@markchapman these Super Bowl officials are a joke.  Decisions made in seconds. Obviously no thought process going into it at all. VAR could teach these guys a lot
No.54 turning Super Bowl 54
I am watching the #SuperBowl but I really don't understand the game.
😂😂😂😂😂

Why are they celebrating like they have s touchdown when they just got an interception??
I’m so SHOOK, she really did what needed to be done. I fucking love her! #Shakira #SuperBowl https://t.co/yD65JYMrqM
That could be the ball game right there.

#NFLUK #SuperBowl
The kid Mahomes feeling the pressure #SuperBowl
Working the Superbowl at @SourcePreston - Pretty busy, but the by far the biggest cheers of the night so far have gone to Shakira and J-Lo.
Intercepted! Nice work #SanFrancisco49ers! Let's see a #touchdown now. #SuperBowl 🏆🏈
49ers to take this now 👌🏻 #SuperBowl #NFL @NFLUK 🏈
What a game!! #SuperBowl
YESSS!!! Fred Warner with the interception! LETS FUCKING GO!!! #49ers #SuperBowl #SuperBowLIV
Terrible throw by Mahomes #Superbowl
Like goff last year occasion is getting to Mahomes #SuperBowl
Interception... huge pressure by the #49ers defense. Huge turnover... #KCvsSF #SuperBowl
The fuck was that patrick? #SuperBowl

'Joe Cool' &amp; 'Flash 80` got me hooked on a weird, bloody tough, confusing as hell, but incredibly exciting game many, many moons ago ago. Joe &amp; Steve Young were QB legends. The fact Joe played for both Superbowl LIV teams makes it even better, and the ❤️ has to follow the start! https://t.co/Pwbp3QxMAV

Watching #SuperBowl this late. In my favourite place in the entire world.... my birthday in about 72 hours... but I’m missing my favourite people. It’s that time again  ✈️ 🌍
@ajcdeane @TychoNestoris1 @BistuaNuova Actually it’s one of the better ones I’ve seen... Rolling Stones we’re awesome, Prince was incredible - but my fave was Bruno Mars (Super Bowl 48 - but my team won that year so I’m obviously biased lol )
Just going to leave this here 👀🏈 #shakira #SuperBowl #HalftimeShow https://t.co/IJit7K7I5E
We take the lead 13-10 with a field goal. Lets go! #49ers #SuperBowl
@domjoly Something about #SuperBowl half time show reduces all to meh 🥱 even Stones, Prince and forgive me Springsteen couldn’t do their thang
Nice field goal #SanFrancisco49ers. They take the lead 13-10 in #SuperBowl 🏈🏆
How the hell did jimmy not see KITTLE wide open there? #SuperBowLIV #SuperBowl
Best half time show ever....🤤 #SuperBowl #bbcnfl #ShakiraBowl
Mon the @Chiefs! 🙌🏻 #bbcnfl #SuperBowl #SuperBowLIV #KCvsSF #SanFrancisco49ers #KansasCityChiefs
Enjoyed the halftime show, Shakira and Jennifer Lopez. I thought they might do more of a collaboration, not a collaboration with J Balvin. But good show by two good entertainers.  #HalftimeShow #SuperBowl #nfl100 #JLoSuperBowl #ShakiraXJLoSuperBowl #Shakira

Crikey O'Riley, that was one of the best half time shows I've ever seen. Shakira and JLo absolutely killed it. Possibly the best since the last time the #SuperBowl was in Miami and THAT performance from Prince...
@shakira and @JLo Super Bowl performance! amazing ladies! 😮🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
If the answer to your question isn't @shakira then you're asking the wrong question. #bbcnfl #SuperBowl

To be fair if you took me to the #SuperBowl I'd fall asleep as well.  It's like they combined all the full bits if rugby and Australian Rules Football into one far too long game 

Christ the World Cup could be over in the time it takes to get to the end of the first half.
That halftime show was surprisingly pretty fucking good! #SuperBowl
Great to see the rapper was wearing a fire retardant suit.......health &amp; safety first. #SuperBowl #HalftimeShow

@liammcr_ It is. After the Superbowl performance I just remembered how amazing Empire is as well. And then it reminded me of how good Can't Remember to Forget You is. 😍

#SuperBowl Very high energy, I got exhausted for J-Lo and Shakira. Choreography was top notch. Nice to have a Puerto Rico message. Sneaky of J-Lo to add ‘Jenny from the Block’. Seriously, with performers like these two, why would you ever get Maroon 5 for a live show?
@NFLGamePassHelp are you kidding???? Dropped out twice on Super Bowl night WTF
#bbcnfl that half time was just an arse fest, that has caused a worldwide semi. 2 billion sperm will be wasted tonight, as our loved ones sleep  #SuperBowl #Shakira #JLoSuperBowl https://t.co/yY0CG55GPm

Lmfao this has to be one of the worse super bowl half time shows I’ve ever seen.
ABSOLUTELY AMAZES ME HOW SHAKIRA (43 YEARS OF AGE) AND JENNIFER LOPEZ (50 YEARS OF AGE) PULLED OFF A TOTAL INCREDIBLE SHOW OMGGGGG! Female energy was sickkkkkk!!!! #SuperBowl
so much better than last year’s super bowl; both game wise and half time show wise 🙌🏻🏈 let’s go Chiefs #SuperBowl
I just had a workout #HalftimeShow #SuperBowl
LOVED the Latina vibes for the #HalftimeShow how amazing does Shakira &amp; JLO look?!
Now I just need a lottery win so I can look that good at their age ✌🏼

When Shakira and JLo burst into Waka Waka I was hoping it was the start of a World Cup songs medley they’d do a bit of We’re in the Ball by Ant and Dec #SuperBowl
Normal football half time shows aren't like that in England. We just get Greg from the fanzine doing a fucking tombola #SuperBowl #HalftimeShow
Why they playing drum and bass at #SuperBowl
Stayed up to watch the 49ers in the Superbowl. Pretty tense at half time. To de-stress I’m imagining what the ‘Robinson’s half time show’ at the FA cup final would be like. Gary Barlow, a brass band and that married couple from Strictly?
What a half time show 💦💦 #SuperBowl
Well the Latino American population have definitely had their full this #HalftimeShow 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 #SuperBowl. Definitely can’t hate on how good J-Lo and Shakira look either 👀
WOW!

JLo and Shakira...

Just WOW!

JLo has always been an idol of mine but like that woman is 50 and the moves she just pulled off was phenom! 

Now I wish I was out out 😂

#SuperBowl #SBLIV
So, like, have @BBCSport just lost use of their studio for the rest of the game? #SuperBowl #BBCSuperBowl #BBCNFL
Great show tbh, both bloody gorgeous 😍 🥰🥰 #SuperBowl
Can't be the only one who was hoping for a surprise appearance from @maluma at the #PepsiHalftime show #SuperBowl ... Regardless - What a show from J-Lo and Shakira ! 

Time for second half now
No Superbowl half time performance could compare to when Destiny’s child performed
Wow wow wow #SuperBowl
I feel like I know their arses more than their faces... that was... uhhh... a whole lot of arse!...
#SuperBowl #SuperBowl2020 #SuperBowlHalftimeShow

Shakira and JLo just won the superbowl. Come again next year plz. 🍑 #SuperBowl
OH JENNIFER YOU ARE A JOKE #SuperBowl #HalftimeShow
Shakira was by far the best part of that half time show!! #SuperBowl #SuperBowlHalftimeShow
That was easily the best 15 minutes of me life la #SuperBowl

Half time show #SuperBowl there have been a lot better than that. 
Game is brilliant, too close to call 10-10 scoreline between #sf49ers #KCChiefs
J-Lo and Shakira at half time.... that was.... I’m hard 😍 #superbowl
that was the best and most fun super bowl halftime show ever 
the whites are quaking and I love it lol
Jennifer Lopez and Shakira... combined age of 93 😮😮 #SuperBowl
Fiesta latina en Miami.

Que gran show #SuperBowl #Shakira #JLO #Miami
Watching my dad walk out on me was less depressing then that #HalftimeShow #SuperBowl
For a couple of auld birds @shakira and @JLo can fuckin move!! @SkySportsNFL @NFLUK #SuperBowl
J Lo v Shakira was a tight game but I think Jenny from the block won. #SuperBowl

Best #SuperBowl in a few years. Like I said right down to the wire. #SuperBowl #ChiefsKingdom
I’m not that bothered who wins #SuperBowl but absolutely furious at bs referee calls yet again.  That was no way TD, foot in touch before ball over plane - no doubt.  Refs decide who wins SB as usual #bbcnfl
What an amazing game! Chefs all the way 🔥 #SuperBowl
#bbcnfl check Jerry rice touchdown v Bengals in superbowl of 1989 - replica of Williams for Chiefs just there.
This is exciting, #SuperBowl I'm totally neutral. There's been some excellence played. #Raiders

Been worth staying up for unlike last year's #SuperBowl 

Could go either way but both teams would be worthy winners.

Yes! Come on @Chiefs!! 😁🙌🏻 #SuperBowl #SuperBowlLIV #SFvsKC #bbcnfl #SuperBowl54 #SanFrancisco49ers #KansasCityChiefs #touchdown
What a Super Bowl this is 🏈💪🇺🇸 https://t.co/kjHb94ajpc
49ers not really a quick strike offence, even against this defence... this is tough to win for them #SuperBowl
Been a cracking #SuperBowl to be fair, pretty rare
Come on Defence it’s time to step up and do your thing and bring the #SuperBowl home to #KansasCity
Super Bowl.... https://t.co/yJxIcMfGgI
Now the stage is set for Jimmy Garoppolo to lead the 49ers on a #SuperBowl winning drive... #SB54
Keep that momentum going #SanFrancisco49ers! You can win #SuperBowl 🏈🏆
What an end to the game we have now!! #SuperBowl
😬 #SuperBowl https://t.co/SGFvnrtw9R https://t.co/Vqt9cU6tJl
What the actual fuck #GamePass is down again with 3 mins to go. Absolute bullshit. #SuperBowl

I think he was out #SuperBowl
Wow. Just Wow. Mahomes moving the ball with ease right now. #SuperBowl
If only we'd had video refs when Bradford Northern scored that dodgy try in the Challenge Cup at Belle Vue. I blame Peter Fox's Green Bay Packers cap. #SuperBowl
Excellent call #SuperBowl
That’s not a touchdown fuck these refs have been appalling ! #SuperBowl #SuperBowlLIV

This is like watching the electoral college votes roll in from Iowa #SuperBowl #VAR
@bbcnfl has @Carlsonsports has a vast knowledge can he answer my question Q) how many teams have NOT won the SuperBowl? Thanks
Deixei de entrar no pub perto de casa pra ver o super bowl pq eu não quero beber! Auto controle rendeu hj.
Agora mandem link do super bowl pq eu to triste querendo ver
Gamepass International may have gone down for a second time in the Super Bowl
What an ending this is @georgiebingham #SuperBowl
Thought the game was dead and buried at 20-10! How wrong was I? What a fourth quarter! #SuperBowl #SuperBowlLIV https://t.co/39Mb4EEBmu
I think it's gonna stand #SuperBowl
Fuuuuuck this is tense #SuperBowl
Yeah Baby 😁#SuperBowl
It's 3am in London &amp; the Superbowl is a good ass game. This bar is fucking wild rn!
You have to give it to Mahomes. He's a baller! Great turn around if this TD stands #Superbowl
It's close #SuperBowl
Some game this I can’t handle it #SuperBowlLIV #SuperBowl
WOWSER! #SuperBowl
You need to pull your finger out #SanFrancisco49ers! Get down the field &amp; score another #touchdown! #SuperBowl 🏈🏆
Sums up the terrible ref calls. #SuperBowl
That’s not a touchdown surely... #SuperBowl 👀
I think it’s no good #SuperBowl
SuperBowl Wings - Tayaraki, Chilli 🌶, garlic and sesame 👍- Thoughts ??? https://t.co/WKFc7g4OZN
Holy shit!! The chiefs have nicked this! 49ere have fucked it in the 4th quarter of the super bowl
Wow #chiefs lead #SuperBowl could be out of bounds tho
Holy shit. I didn't think that would be a Chiefs touchdown...

#SBLIV #SuperBowl
This fucking bloke #SuperBowl
Great game but decided by shocking calls at key times by the officials. #SuperBowl #SuperBowlLIV #SuperBowl2020
Kickoff was at 6:30pm, local time. Accounting for ad breaks and the unique way that the Superbowl is timed, it's currently 5pm. They're in, like, the 4th Half of something by now.
@KarisaMaxwell Hey I know that guy...It’s me waiting for the Redskins to return to the @SuperBowl #HTTR
Mahomes finally turning it on! @Chiefs showing us the definition of clutch #superbowl
Ha. Shows you what I know 🤣 #SBLIV #Superbowl https://t.co/W8TSyivdG5
I had been following Nfl since 2012 and every single Superbowl have made goosebumps all over my skin. No regrets to stay up all night long. #bbcnfl
Kyle Shanahan fast becoming the Head Choke of #SuperBowl
Jesus the Chiefs have just made some real ground! #SuperBowl
Wow Kid #Mahomes #SuperBowl #TheTimeIsNow
Superbowl is fucking FUN in London!!!
#mahomes turning it on when it matters.  Absolute baller. #SuperBowl
Oh dang, absolute scenes right now #SuperBowl
The tide has turned,mahomes finishing strong,cheifs will piss this now #SuperBowl
We have fallen apart defensively #SuperBowl
Sammy Watkins!!!! Yes son!! #SuperBowl
Strong from Sherman #SuperBowl
Mahomes woke up! #SuperBowl
It's looking like #Mahomes time #SuperBowl
Damn, still can’t call this. Feels like it should be 49ers but I’m not sure #SuperBowl #bbcnfl

Huge 3 and out from the @Chiefs LET’S GO CHIEFS! #SuperBowl #SBLIV
Ooh what's going to happen next #SuperBowl
Oof, ya hate to see that head-on-head contact 😬 #SuperBowl
@markchapman Good job...Always enjoy the BBC’s blissfully ad free @SuperBowl coverage...you’ve come a long way as a presenter..I remember you when you were Chappers on Chris Moyles show turning your nose up an dissing NFL..Pleased you have seen the light!
WTF. Kyle run the damn ball. #SuperBowl
Bottling it. No way do the Chiefs not score on this play #SuperBowl
@Jerry_DurhamPT Looks like it’s going to be a nail biter Jerry #SuperBowl
Wow #SuperBowl
#NFL wasn't looking forward to the superbowl without the Patriots but it's been am awesome game.  Glad I stayed up and ate cake.
Kelceeeee‼️ #SuperBowl
Come on @Chiefs you can do this #SuperBowl
Right after #Mahomes turned up, it's time #Garoppolo to earn his keep #SuperBowl
Defences win championships. Unless you’re Tarvarius Moore. Idiot. #SuperBowl
I tell you this is one superb owl. #SuperBowlLIV #SuperBowl
49ers defence is so hard 🔥 Nick Bosa is bossing it 💪🏼 #SuperBowl
Calling it now, 9ers get the FG and Mahommes takes it for a game winning drive. He gets his super bowl and I get my 99 overall MVP card...let's make this happen Patrick!!!
What a throw by Mahomes!! #SuperBowl #ChiefsKingdom https://t.co/HpJDBoxhhK
What a finish this is about to be in the Super Bowl 🤯
Blimey... this is a close one now. Great drive by @Chiefs #SuperBowl 20-17
As soon as Mahomes gets a bit more time in the pocket he starts to work his magic! #Mahomes #SuperBowl #bbcnfl
Damn the Chiefs are finally bringing the heat 🔥🔥 #SuperBowl #SuperBowl2020 #SuperBowlLIV Finally at 17 so fast!!
@drwhofan_194 You're probably the only person I know that's up now that ISN'T tweeting about the Super Bowl!
Not over until #mahomes and #kelse say its over! #SuperBowl
Moore blew that. Turn the fuck around. #SuperBowl
#bbcnfl that was some drive.. Still think the 49's will win #SuperBowl
49ers on the back foot! #SuperBowl
C'mon that's the @PatrickMahomes magic we've been waiting on  #SuperBowl #Chiefs #Touchdown 🏈
That is basically free points, idiocy from SF #SuperBowl
Three points in it and six minutes 13 seconds of play left. Eep...

#SBLIV #SuperBowl
Squeaky bum time #SuperBowl
Oh no. #SuperBowl  #49ers
We have a ball game again! #SuperBowl
Now that makes it very interesting... great few minutes from @PatrickMahomes #SuperBowl
#Bollocks was that #passinterference! That should not have been allowed. #SuperBowl 🏆🏈
Oh my,  Chiefs are back in it! #SuperBowl
GAME ON!!! Just what was needed for the neutral! Fascinating end to this game! #SuperBowl #SuperBowlLIV
Fuck’s sake. How the fuck can you pull a boneheaded play like this in the Super Bowl of all places????? #SBLIV
Oof, but if the Niners keep committing howlers like that, it’s plenty of time 🤦🏻‍♂️ #SuperBowl
Bottling this #SuperBowl no way should that 44 yard pass happen. Shambles
The strategy is excellent. By both teams #SuperBowl
Damnit. Chiefs get the TD back and it’s a 3 point game again. #SuperBowl
Oh my! Game back on!! #SuperBowl
Chiefs back in this #SuperBowl
Why did they use a bar blade to open that @budweiserusa bottle in the SuperBowl ad when it’s obvious it’s a twist cap 🤦🏻‍♀️ #SuperBowlAds #SBLIV
Huge flag for DPI there. Obvious though he never turned around at all! #SuperBowl
@TomFreaknBrady Not the Super bowl without a @TomBrady shirt https://t.co/EOmJW4ojqL
Excellent work #KC #SuperBowl
Mahomes = cojones #SuperBowl
Correct call on the #incompletepass, but all credit to the #KansasCityChiefs, that was a lovely pass to make up for it. #SuperBowl 🏈🏆
Wow #SuperBowl #bbcnfl #Mahomes
Chris brown should perform at Next year's Super Bowl
Bigg playy #SuperBowl
Signs of life from the Chiefs. Bit late, mind #SuperBowl
That 44 yard throw like...

😍😍😍

#SuperBowl #SBLIV
What a throw and catch! 44 yards, big play in the big game 😮 #KCvsSF #SBLIV #SuperBowl #NFL100
What a throw Manhones #SuperBowl #
Pathetic #SuperBowl
Huge throw!!! Mahomes &amp; Hill wake up at last! #SuperBowl
CLUTCH!!! #SUPERBOWL
Wow #Mahomes #SuperBowl
What a throw from Mahomes. #SuperBowl
The bazooka is out! #SuperBowl @Chiefs
@NFL I wasn't looking forward to superbowl this year without the @Patriots but I've totally enjoyed the game...and all the cake I've consumed tonight.
#bbcnfl 3rd year of us watching the Super Bowl at our overseas home in Camden.. #letsgocowboys
I fell asleep and now I’m trying to avoid Super Bowl spoilers on Twitter like... https://t.co/I1be6CLXfu
Good Challenge. Looks like should be going back to 3rd and long #SuperBowl
49ers might just get that challenge? #SuperBowl
Wild Thornberry’s absolutely ruled! #SuperBowl https://t.co/VuRgod14JM
So are the Chiefs going to do something or they are stuck at 10 points till now? #SuperBowl #SuperBowl2020 https://t.co/YPfvwLueEX
Im guessing @Drake is a Chiefs fan tonight hence their no show performance. Curse strikes again! #SuperBowl
Not only is the time of the super bowl great this year the fact no cray people are banging on my hotel room wall is also a plus
#SuperBowl - Great Game ✅, Great Beers✅, 3rd Q Snooze Done✅, Ready for a full on 4th✅ https://t.co/YTqfNgSenN
True vibes and full dedication to the #SuperBowl tonight at 2.30 in the morning 🙈😂🏈 https://t.co/AktKB9Lyaf
That missed offside call could cost San Fran. #SuperBowl
We are entering the “let’s see if Kyle Shanahan has learned to kill the clock in the Super Bowl yet” phase of the game #SuperBowl
Defender wins Championships is never truer than in the Super Bowl. KC learning the hard way.
Chiefs got away with that false start... #SuperBowl
The officiating here is an absolute joke. #SuperBowl #bbcnrl
Chiefs defense did a big job there, still hanging in there, just! #KCvsSF #SBLIV #SuperBowl #NFL100 (btw, was that a false start by 92 defense?! 🤔)
These Refs maaaaaaate #SuperBowl

Only four of the last 20 Super Bowl MVPs have been defensive players. Surely there's a strong chance we're on for a fifth? #SuperBowlLIV
#SuperBowl well that was a waste of an int
#NFL #SuperBowl2020 #SuperBowl @Chiefs @49ers
So, I fell asleep 😂😂😂
#SuperBowl
how are @BarackObama and @MichelleObama loving that #SuperBowl #HalftimeShow @shakira @JLo ❤️
#SuperBowlLIV Mahomes has stage fright, it’s the 49ers super bowl to lose, Chiefs have been disappointing
Jimmy G has been here before, knows how to handle it. Learned from Brady. Has a superb coach calling a perfect game. Kills me to say it but Niners have this comfortably now. #SuperBowl
#Bbcnfl #SuperBowl what happens if it’s a draw?
@49ers managed the life out of this game. Didn’t think it would happen.  #SuperBowl
@bZbmB I always forget this when im watching the superbowl.. then when its over im like damn... thats that
Looks like it’s coming home for the 49ers... what a game it’s been so far though #SuperBowl
Mahomes is having a shocker ☹️ #SuperBowl
Goff crumbled last year. Mahomes crumbling this year... SuperBowl stage is a heavy load to carry! #SuperBowl
Mahomes having a nightmare #SBLIV #Superbowl
Go niners!  #SuperBowlLIV #SuperBowl
Terrible throw! So far behind Hill he had no chance. Mahomes has crumbled under the pressure tonight. So far..... I still can’t write him off yet #SuperBowl
There's a guy on the Superbowl called Tivarius .... I mean; what a name...I couldn't be less interested #SuperBowl
And that is probably the play that wins the super bowl #SuperBowl #49ers #bbcnfl
Another superb #interception by the #SanFrancisco49ers! Make it another #touchdown now guys! #SuperBowl 🏈🏆
Se acabo el súper bowl, San Francisco campeón
Interception!! 49’ers need to keep the ball on the ground now #SuperBowl #SuperBowlLIV
That could be all she wrote? #SuperBowl
PAtty sewing ghosts !!! Let’s gooooo #SuperBowl
That interception could be the game for the #49ers 😮 #KCvsSF #SuperBowl #SBLIV #NFL100
GAME OVER #SuperBowl
ARGH!!!! MASSSIVE!!!! #bbcnfl #SuperBowl
Oh dear oh dear. Game Over. #SuperBowl
Remember when people said we should of drafted Mahomes LOL #SuperBowl
Oh my life! THE best Super Bowl half-time show ever. SHAKIRA and J-LO causing havoc in Miami. 🇨🇴❤️🇵🇷 @shakira @JLo #SuperBowl #SuperBowlLIV #Shakira #JLo
Game over #SuperBowl
Chiefs way off the pace tonight. Niners defence just too good #SuperBowl
Still find it funny that the 49ers have a guard in their team called Person...

#SBLIV #SuperBowl
Man...The Chiefs suck tonight #SuperBowl
Chiefs will probably need 3TD to win this assuming the 49ers will score. #SFvsKC #SuperBowl #SBLIV #NFL100 #bbcnfl
Awesome coverage of the #SuperBowl from @BBCSport . Brilliant job @markchapman and the boys. I’m purchasing that blue tux jacket.

Nov 2018.... got to watch the 49ers limp thru their season with injured QB’s

Now a year later they are 20 mins away from being Super Bowl  champs..

The 49ers are starting to take control of this Superbowl. 

For a bit in the 1st half the Chiefs were in control

Now the 49ers just need to close the game the game out for a 6th Superbowl win. 

@49ers #SuperBowl
#bbcnfl The @49ers are so close to touching a ring. Looks like @PatrickMahomes needs to be MAHHHHHOOOOMMMMMEEESSSS. Boom or bust time. #SuperBowl https://t.co/9glT8GhGF7
@BritishBirdgang This one has gone now I think #SuperBowl
The Chiefs need Mahomes to step up and make some big big plays. #Superbowl

The one negative will be if the 49ers win the Superbowl, we'll probably have to listen to the "should the Patriots of kept Jimmy G" narrative
Great night watching the @SuperBowl at my mates pub with great friends #SuperBowl well done @Chiefs https://t.co/nqFi9KyvNL
I tell you what, that Super Bowl was amazing. The view from behind my eye lids was next to none. I’ll do that again sometime
The only NFL team that I’ve ever supported since 1994, when I first learned what is American football, lost of words &amp; in tears of joy, proud to be a Chiefs fan and to all the Chiefs fan, HOW BOUT THOSE CHIEFS!!!! 👉💪💯😭🥳 #chiefs #kansascitychiefs #superbowl #champs https://t.co/mavlxzKKOu
@FCBarcelona @Chiefs @SuperBowl Amazingly open game until KC n QB got back in it Game Over. 
Why with 6 minutes to go 10 points in front and you don't run it. Big error.
You left this in the locker room, Niners... #49ers #superbowl https://t.co/WpXwl3nePn
@bigbadclarkey @HartnettHockey @NFLUK @AtlantaFalcons Superb evening! Thanks for hosting a lovely evening! @HannahFreeman25 &amp; I really enjoyed that! #Superbowl
@MatthewHall15 My pre-season pick came off! Just wish I put down more than the tenner. Niners controlled most of the game as well and their constant blitz package had “Mahomboy” rattled a fair amount. Not quite sure that was a TD though...#SuperBowl https://t.co/mg6KkMp7PB
The average price of a super bowl ticket is $2,500 so let’s be grateful here https://t.co/7pRMbTmKyX
Felicidades a los Chiefs, grandísimas temporada, culminada con una gran Super Bowl.
Ya habrá tiempo de reflexionar.
Pero ahora mismo lo que sale decir es, Mahomes, eres la leche.

@thereallisaann Stoked that you had an amazing time...I am just over the moon/state of disbelief at this moment...3.40am here but don’t care one bit...so glad booked Monday off work...Super Bowl Champions and 2020-21 TNF season opener at Arrowhead..I can’t wait to be there! 🙌🏼😱😱😍🏈
@callumwashere When that happened, @HannahFreeman25 asked "doesn't the captain lift it". I said that it's always the owners. She said "that's such an American thing" #superbowl
The saddest part of the Super Bowl is knowing there’s now no football for 6 months
Chiefs!!! #SuperBowl
@base615 @SuperBowl @BBCSport Loads of people have contacted Gamepass and are all getting responses saying they won't be offering any refunds.

Watched the 2nd half not understanding it but interested. After the #KCChiefs win, they seem to be giving a lot if the credit to 1 man. Fair played all the same #bbcnfl
It’s time to focus on the real winners of the SuperBowl... Shakira and JLo
#Mega #Congratulations to @Chiefs #SuperBowl #Champions especially #MattMoore and #DamienWilliams two of my favorite x @MiamiDolphins players
Two largest comebacks in super bowl history on Shannihan’s headtop hmmm
Chris Jones didn't win Super Bowl MVP, but he was sensational tonight. Absolutely brilliant on the interior.

That series before HT sticks out more. 49ers could have gone in 7 or 3 up but settled for 10-10. Lost by 11 but the optics change if its 17/13-10.
Yayy #ChiefsKingdom #SuperBowl
Mahomes MVP. What a joke! Williams was robbed. #SBLIV #Superbowl
First time I’ve ever stayed up and actually watched the Super Bowl from start to finish and I actually really enjoyed it, I tip my hat to the BBC for their coverage too, really Informative and fun without being patronising to a novice like me.

10/10, will watch again

#SuperBowl
Kyle choked the SuperBowl again I can’t believe it.
What a game man #SuperBowl
Aside from all that though it’s impossible not to be happy for Andy Reid. A first #SuperBowl win for one of the sport’s finest characters.
On balance, a fantastic season for the @49ers. Came up short against an all time great QB. Patrick Mahomes is going to a major problem for years to come #SuperBowl
#KansasCityChiefs #NFL Props to the Chiefs and the explosive comeback in the 4th quarter to win Superbowl 54. Mahomes was  huge and stood so tall. Superb game.
How can the Super Bowl be the world championship when it’s only the Americans in it
#bbcnfl #Howboutthemchiefs Well done KC, @PatrickMahomes stepped all the way up 👏🏾👏🏾 #SuperBowl #NFL #SuperBowlLIV
Always find it odd in American Football how the owner receives the Vince Lombardi trophy and not the coach and players. #SuperBowl @NFLUK
I couldn’t sleep so put it on. The last 3 minutes of the game lasted about 25 minutes lol I saw the last two touchdowns though. #SuperBowl now for some sleep 😴
Jimmy G missing a wide open Sanders will sting for a while for Niners fans.... #SuperBowl

Y hoy en el Super Bowl estuvieron representados Barranquilla, Cali, Medellín... y donde está ¿Bogota?Moraleja- la sabrosura de nuestro país solo la encuentra en provincia, no se diga más!
Patrick Mahomes is a 24 year old man who has just lit up the whole of the NFL and he’s going to be the best in this league for a long time! Andy Reid and Travis Kelce are fucking heroes. 

#ChiefsKingdom #SuperBowl https://t.co/RhNrGjVPqj

Absolutely thrilled the 49ers didn’t win the Super Bowl, glad for the Chiefs, they’ve been a joy to watch the past two years! 👍
Boooom....payout bookies @PatrickMahomes is the #SuperBowlMVP #SuperBowl
The trophy presentation always makes my blood boil every year... why do the owners have to pick up the trophy the players just stood there like they didn’t just win the game lol #SuperBowl
What a shit trophy presentation tho. They hand it to the club owners first, Wtf! Also there's no Hendo shuffle #SuperBowl
Well played to the @Chiefs. Well deserved. Been a magnificent season and a fitting #SuperBowl to finish it off.
@49ers got further than we ever expected this season. Nobody believed in this team. It's been an unbelievable run. Off to bed it is. #NinerNation #SBLIV https://t.co/RKlNMd17Hz

Thoroughly enjoyed the #SuperBowl nail-biting stuff in the final 10 🤯

Is it just me or is the trophy celebration/presentation utterly shit? 
#SuperBowl #SuperBowlLIV
Just despicable that #GamePass will not be refunding customers, despite completely failing to broadcast the last crucial 4 minutes of the @SuperBowl. I'm thankful that we had the @bbcsport coverage to fall back on... others around the world will not have been so lucky.

Superbowl lineup https://t.co/rrTEPbBfUs
The way Paddy Mahomes played in the 2nd and 3rd quarters i doubted that he could lead a comeback like that, but you can't teach shit like that and he's only 24 yrs old , great game to watch loved it #SuperBowl
Can’t wait for the Trubisky Vs Mahomes SuperBowl next year
@SamanthaQuek @Chiefs Chiefs win Superbowl and Liverpool win Premier League🤞🏻- what year for you!
@BBCSport Don't bring back Mark Chapman back for next year's Superbowl, he makes Neil Reynolds look competent! Dude is a moron!
CHAMPIONS!!!!! #ChiefsKingdom #SuperBowl Get in there!! Dug deep and found what they needed. What a game. Tense is an understatement. CHIEFSSSSS!!!!!
I really need to fly home! This is unreal!!! #SUPERBOWL #ChiefsKingdom
Fully deserved for the #ChiefsKingdom congrats #SuperBowl champs!
Mahomes was rattled for 3 quarters, Niners defence had him on the ropes. But what a player he is to produce that  comeback. Absolutely superb. Incredible. #SuperBowl #ChiefsKingdom
Bitterly disappointed, but if you'd asked me in September would we be involved on Super Bowl night I'd have laughed. 

We gave it our best shot, but to see a 10 point lead disintegrated is a wounder 😔😔

I’m sorry I can’t watch them all suck Mahomes off. The guy was not that good today. Yet they will crown him the best of all time. Yet he relied on us choking and the refs and he got lucky. Fuck it. #SuperBowl #49ers
Great Superbowl with deserved winners. Well done Chiefs for bringing it back late on. Pat Mahomes has some career ahead of him.

What what a game just WOW. Well done to Andy Reid and the Kansas City Chiefs! Long overdue. Congratulations from a Raider Fan. #bbcnfl #SuperBowl #SuperBowlLIV #NFL @Chiefs https://t.co/UITv51ojvK
If Patrick Mahomes is this much of an animal at 24 years old, it’s scary to think what he’ll do in the future. Congrats, Kansas City! #SuperBowl #SuperBowlLIV #bbcnfl
A great #SuperBowl maybe the best team lost but Mahomes is the GOAT
Congratulations @Chiefs #SuperBowl
Someone let me know what odds Skybet were offering for Orange, for the Gatorade coach Bath? #SuperBowl
Legend in the making - @PatrickMahomes #SuperBowl
#SuperBowl rubbish end to a great game
Congratulations Kansas ... I love Andy Reid to be fair ... there’s worse teams out there 😢 #SuperBowl
@Chri6ViF...... Andy Reid's 222nd win..... On the 2nd of the 2nd 2020!!!!#superbowl #49ersvschiefs #spooky 🏈🎉
What a quarter. What a game! Mahomes is just incredible, probably my favourite sportsman, of any game, in the world right now! How ‘bout those Chiefffssss!!  #SuperBowl https://t.co/jPL9uWvCXd
Yusssssss #SuperBowl
Well it’s the #Chiefs year and it was an exciting game.  Feel sorry for the #49ers having made a fantastic  turnaround from last year. They have the team to come back and go one better next year. Next time they can play my team @Raiders  in Superbowl.  #SBLIV  #NFL100

@Mathieu_Era bet on himself and is now a Super Bowl winner.
Kansas Chiefs just won the Super Bowl! Jimmy Garoppolo might have won it for the Francisco 49ers, except everyone knows there is no such thing as a Garoppolo#SuperBowl54 #Gruffalo
Amazing game. Never a chance of calling this one early... 
Gutted for 49ers, but Mahones and the Chiefs very worthy winners! 
#SuperBowl #goodnight
Buzzing for @TheRealFrankC_! What a game, what a comeback. #SuperBowl

They really need to look into security on the pitch with regards to journalism and paparazzi.
those players and staff just won the SuperBowl and most look genuinely scared from the mob of cameras running at them and shoving them around so they can’t get to their team or family
Congratulations to @Chiefs for the #SuperBowl 🏈
In the end I think the @49ers probably played too many tough games down the stretch and just ran out of steam in the final quarter of the final game against a generational talent QB &amp; HoF coach. That’s pretty damn impressive. 

Take that into next year! #SuperBowl
@ShannonSharpe just ammunition for 2moro, Skip would give brady superbowl mvp if he got the game winning drive regardless how he played the rest of the game
#bbcnfl Best Superbowl in years. Backwards and forwards. Then @PatrickMahomes and Andy Reid shaked and baked their way to making it happen. They are the magic men. #SuperBowl #NFLUK https://t.co/zUhEOQwdbz
@Drabbleswfc I SEE YOU SUPERBOWL 👀
Start of the season a wouldn’t of dreamed of being in the superbowl, much love for the boys go again next year #49ers #SBLIV

Mahomes magic in the 4th. Congrats Chiefs #SBLIV #SuperBowl
Well fuck me, @Chiefs are #SuperBowl champions! #chiefsKingdom
Wow KC won the Super Bowl after being behind through the whole game the 4th round they caught up!
Wow 😮 well done Kansas City!💯

Great season by the 49ers, congrats to the Chiefs. Essentially came down to the QB’s. Mahomes clearly superior to Jimmy G! #SuperBowl #SuperBowlLIV #NinersFaithful https://t.co/yqs9Nr0CHN
Hi.

Talk Superbowl to me. 😉😍 https://t.co/03eK2jmqW4
What a game! #SuperBowl How about those #Chiefs ! #BBCNFL
Absolutely buzzing for Andy Reid. He deserves this.

Mahomes played just okay, but clutch when he needed to be.

#SuperBowl
Great game! Delighted Reid has a #SuperBowl win and also that @PatrickMahomes gets one out of  way early in his career. It should be the first of many for him with this team #BBCNFL
For saying I’ve got no idea about the nfl the rules or anything I’ve managed to pick the winner @Chiefs #SuperBowl @bbcnfl #bbcnfl
Kansas City Chiefs are the Wolves of the NFL. What a comeback. #SuperBowl
Mahomes 3rd and 15 conversion changed the game. Great game. Delighted for Andy Reid. Shanahan will win a boat load anyway. Bedtime! #SuperBowl #KCChiefs #49ers
GET IN....Superb victory for the @Chiefs! One of the best Superbowl games I’ve seen in years. Andy Reid finally wins his 1st SuperBowl, well deserved! #SuperBowl #BBCNFL https://t.co/8HlWnY8M3x

Mahomes was terrible for 3 quarters. Killed a whole team in that 4th.

Immortals.

#SuperBowl https://t.co/dBlyzkonP4
Long live Andy Reid. Class #SuperBowl! #ChiefsKindgom
Happy for Andy Reid to finally get his Superbowl ring. Well deserved. I guess the old adage that defence wins championships is still true but having a damn explosive offense helps a lot too. An amazing finale to the #NFL season #chiefsnation #SuperBowl
Best team lost on the day. At least the 49ers won’t match the @Patriots Super bowl record this year.
Patrick Mahomes.....SUPERSTAR!

Well done to the Kansas City Chiefs, great fourth quarter performance. #SuperBowl
Well done KC Chiefs! Least we actually got a lot better SuperBowl than we did last year. Though my favourite Super Bowl is 2017 when NE come back from 21-0 down to beat the Falcons.

Well done Chiefs! #SuperBowl

I'm so happy for Andy Reid. Absolutely overjoyed. He deserves this. One of the best ever, gets way too much crap. He's finally done it. That knock of "he's never won a Super Bowl" can never be held against him ever again. EVER.
Game set and match. Well played @Chiefs 

#BBCNFL #SuperBowl #SuperBowlLIV https://t.co/154L7xA9zU
Well, commiserations to the Niners fans. Been there. Congrats to the Chiefs. Overall, much better game than last year #SuperBowl
@49ers just threw it away in the 4th 🙈

Fuck!

Going to bed....😑

#SuperBowl
Got to say #Superbowl has been a gem. It's felt close and unpredictable but the bookies had the over/under at 53. Those guys know just how to pitch it.

Importantly, the 6 Lombardi club still has just 2 members.
Just signed off from an exciting night reporting live on the Super Bowl for BBC Radio 2. 

Glad I booked tomorrow off 😂😴 https://t.co/OyjQGIRPcd
Really happy for Andy Reid 

As a side note, my god the Superbowl is so much more enjoyable when the Patriots aren't involved #SuperBowl
Is it even a #SuperBowl without a shermanface https://t.co/okfHkB3KaD
Well done Chiefs. Really played well in the 2nd half. #SuperBowl #ChiefsKingdom 🏈🏈🏈
Great Super Bowl.  Worth staying up.   Hats off to The Chiefs and coach Reid.
Doing what they do best... @Chiefs coming from behind and Andy Reid finally has his superbowl ring. What a game it's been! #SuperBowlLIV #chiefs #AFC
Fair play to Andy Reid, as he finally joins the winning #Superbowl coaches gang

Game over.

Fantastic game.

Chiefs were, by far and away, the best team in the league.

49ers played their part, but Andy Reid, Mahomes and his offence have been immense. #SuperBowl
Why take the timeouts? #SuperBowl
Think the @Chiefs has made a UK fan out of me congratulations #SuperBowl #bbcnfl
Amazing 4th quarter from @Chiefs . Mahomes a real star. Great game and worthy #SuperBowl winners. Glad I managed to stay awake!
So happy for Andy Reid. Deserves it. #SuperBowl
-Kyle going conservative at the end of the first half, should've gone out to put up some points 
-Not running after the Moore pick and after the Kelce touchdown, fell back into the superbowl 51 trap
-Defense falling short when it mattered
Few Hard drives should be getting checked today for the Superbowl mob
How does trump lie on super bowl ads and people still believe it. USA resession been at its worse since he took power. The said took as putin stealing it is not the same as winning

Another year, another Super Bowl. 4:15 finish... getting way too old for this......
Mahomes and the Chiefs can never be written off after that play off comeback run ends in a Super Bowl.

Superb way to end another season🏈
What a #SuperBowl that was! First I’ve watched out instead of half asleep in my scratcher, and in the company of a bonafide former Kansas-resident Chief. Beautiful stuff. 

Buccaneers next year 🙌🏻
The #ChiefsKingdom end the second-longest drought between #superbowl titles. The Jets still hold the record (51 yrs) with the Dolphins now second (47 yrs). The Raiders are third (37 years).

I know Chiefs fans across the Midwest have waited longer than pretty much anyone for a Super Bowl, and they deserve it. In other news, how the heck hasn’t Eric Bienemy been hired as a head coach yet?! Oh yeah, that’s why.
Waking up in Edinburgh to see that the Chiefs won the Super Bowl. First Super Bowl I have missed in God knows how long. Feels weird not having watched. Happy for Andy Reid and Pat Mahomes, who’ve always struck me as two of the nicest guys in the league.
Congrats on @Chiefs for smashing out that superbowl win

For real though, from someone based in the UK, we really miss out on the *entire* Super Bowl experience due to the lack of access to the ads.

What a thoroughly miserable weekend of sport at the weekend.
Town get stuffed at home, England get stuffed in the rugby and the 49ers throw away a 10 point lead in the 4th quarter of the superbowl.
Well done to the kaiser chiefs for winning the super bowl....I hope you enjoyed your RUBY RUBY RUBY after the game.
@shakira and @JLo killed the Super Bowl half time show! 🔥 🔥 

What amazing performances 

I will only be listening to these two today 🎧
Only 3 hours sleep, but staying up with my son to watch the super bowl was sooooooo worth it #fathersontime
The Superbowl spot for #NoTimeToDie says it will "Change Everything"

Last time they said that about this franchise, they made Bond and Blofeld brothers in Spectre, which was the singular most stupid thing to occur since it began in 1962.

So, a bit concerning.
Get the feeling that the Superbowl advertising + halt time show is now bigger than the event itself.  

#SuperBowl
@Chrisherbert196 Nope me neither-not a bloody sport when there’s that many adverts, so much padding or you need that amount of “halftime entertainment” ! The entertainment should come from the game your watching not shakira shaking her hips and don’t get me started on “World” Super Bowl 🤯
Seems there’s a packed 4th quarter to catch up on later! 🙌🏻 #SuperBowl #GoChiefs
The Super Bowl is a protracted entertainment spectacle occasionally interrupted by outbreaks of what almost appears to be sport.
Sony really dropped the ball not putting out a Ghosbusters trailer at the superbowl.. perfect time to show off the original cast/money shot. #SuperBowl #Ghostbustersafterlife #ghostbusters #FilmTwitter
So @shakira mimed most of her performance but is getting all the praise @JLo sang mostly live and is being forgotten about. JLO is my queen ✌🏼 #SuperBowl #PepsiHalftime #PepsiHalftimeShow
Absolutely 🔥 - Congrats @shakira @jlo for an amazing #superbowl #halftimeshow performance - I had the privilege to meet &amp; work with these two beautiful women in my career. Talent + Hard work + Attitude + Balance = LEGACY. 👑  #pepsihalftime #sbliv #miami #shakira #jlo https://t.co/r8RrvKzax1

So glad I watched the Super Bowl on BBC and opted not to have #nflgamepass yes I missed the ads but sounds like I didn’t miss the most important part of the game. Also was able to DVR just in case I fell asleep.
@mark08204191 Ahh right, many thanks, I just thought that I may as well watch the Superbowl, but it isn't half confusing, and what is with all of the flags popping up on the field of play?! 
Either way, I think that I will stick to rugby league! 😁😁
Exactly!! Always the same here! Super Bowl is watched by millions World wide. Its about loving your country. Its patriotic. Not racist like some here like to tell you #SuperBowlLIV https://t.co/qcnRLCU7eM
@DavidSBerry @realDonaldTrump @SuperBowl Both I think - straddles the river IIRC
Last night I was making out with a guy at the pub watching the super bowl and his friend slapped him across the back and said “oy Pat, don’t think your fiancée would fancy this” and I am???? Just SO confused?????? About?? Men????
@kxbrakid ABSOLUTELY Superbowl with a tickle of the finest HOOMOOS
Watched the Superbowl last night.  Couldn't make head nor tail of it.  I'll stick to 🏉.
Have to say I really do like the Snickers Super Bowl ad... is it them moving away from ‘not you when you’re hungry’ or is it just famous enough they don’t need to say it now? #SnickersFixtheWorld https://t.co/j0pEvuva6w

@FootyLimbs That’s their first Super Bowl in fifty years too. Mental how crap this is
don’t think i got to appreciate the super bowl for how good it was last night being so tired. buzzing for mahomes though wee kermit the frog was too good in the 4th and jimmy g went full leeds united. i’m basically in love with shakira now too
@StuartBCasting @JLo And then the super bowl performance!!!! It’s got to be a form of subliminal conversion therapy?

So I didn’t stay up to watch the Super Bowl last night because I was too tired, but two Super Bowl ads that are treading on Twitter just made me cry.
I didn’t even know it was the super bowl?
Proud of my timeline that it took me a good 30 mins to find out who won the Super Bowl &amp; 0.00012 seconds to know how much @shakira &amp; @JLo ATE THAT halftime show
@domcovkid I got home at 4am.... my cat just demanded to be fed. Super Bowl Sunday is great until you have an animal.
@AlBoumPhoto Yikes. At least you know now mikäël 👍
Are you into that super bowl thing then. I don't understand that sport.
It’s a close call today. 
To either, do what I get paid to do, OR watch JLO’s Super Bowl halftime performance on repeat for 8 hours?
Wow the Super Bowl halftime show looks like the rise of evil Disney.
.

Disney was always my friend I never thought it would have been disney....
@almilner05 @49ers Too right, I think their coach deserved it too... the most wins without a Super Bowl!? Maybe the luck just wasn’t on the 49ers side..
That sweet-spot when tech and emotion really align...probably because the person who designed it was solving this particular problem...as highlighted in their SuperBowl Ad 👏 https://t.co/7UqHkvXO6l

I’ll put this out there. Maybe if you were more confident in your own skin, worked on your self and had some more self respect. You would respect #jlohalftime #shakirahalftime more rather than criticising them #SuperBowl
This Super Bowl Half Time show will be remembered 4ever, not just cause of 2 amazing women @JLo @shakira but cause of the diversity and unity within the show
Doesn't matter the background, we are all the same inside. ❤️💜 well done #SBLIV #jlo #shakira

For the first time in history, I had the Monday off after the #SuperBowl having invested months watching the conference matches and telling everyone I couldn't wait to watch the biggest game of the season in full.... instead I fell asleep at 11:25 last night and missed it all. https://t.co/vHusEWwfCd

The one time I decide to miss the #SuperBowl completely, it’s happens to be the best one in years! #SuperBowlLIV

Just woke up after one of the most exciting superbowl games in history please tell me I'm not dreaming and we are Superbowl champions #ChiefsKingdom
You know the sports shit when the highlight of the event is the adverts and half time show #SuperBowl2020 #SuperBowl #shakirahalftime #JenniferLopez
OMG the world is now discussing the best ads in a commercial break ffs.

As I understand it there was some kind of sporting event after the #JLo concert last night..... #SuperBowl #HalftimeShow2020

Big congratulations!

Just heard a BBC radio sports reporter breathlessly telling us – “get this...” – the size of the Superbowl TV audience. Gosh. That’s nearly as big as Eurovision; about a quarter the size of the Cricket World Cup Final; and let’s not start on real football viewing figures...

@acrosspitch gentlemen a question. Why is the NFL final called “Superbowl”? As an Englishman a super bowl is a dish you can get a gallon of soup in.
NFL= Rugby with helmet &amp; pads on 😜😜
Couldn't stay up for #SuperBowl so watched the whole game in 40 minutes this morning - best way to watch  American football.
Great comeback win again from Kansas city - well done coach Andy Reid.
In case you weren't watching the US #SuperBowl feed last night, right after it ended Nintendo's Super Bowl ad aired. Absolutely lovely stuff, especially to someone like me raising a daughter ❤️ https://t.co/CVXdOFvg7T
Booking a spin class @PureGym for 0915 after staying up for Superbowl was not the greatest idea, also had to tackle impending gale on the way in!
The Super Bowl half time show in my opinion was fantastic! Both Shakira and J Lo are goddesses.
I woke up this morning to see the Súper bowl show and is sick!!! Standing ovation for those 2 amazing women who made their way to truly present a Latin show in the gringo spotlight ... salsita, mapale, champeta, reggaetón (of course)
I’m still buzzing !
#SuperBowl #LATINOGANG

It's a popular sport no question just not my cup of tea. Turned it off at half time.

* It has very green leaves in
* Contains lots of seeds
* Fresh sprouts (not the Christmas dinner kind)
* Often with quinoa (keenwah)
* Microgreens from @GrownUnder a distinct possibility
* May contain soya (tofu or tempeh)
* Served in Buddha Bowl
#Vegan
So, what do we take away from the #SuperBowl TV spots? 
•  #Mulan looks great! Lots of wire work in this trailer. 
• #BlackWidowMovie - bad guy Taskmaster riffs on some Captain America moves. 
• #HuntersTV with Pacino hunting down clandestine Nazis? I'm in.
@JLo was the first artist I seen live in London, and I cannot wait for her to announce tour man.:. That superbowl performance 😭
@espn @KirkHerbstreit @anezbitt This really was a friendly Super Bowl, as friendly as something like this can be of course. 😍 both teams.
The worst thing about the #Superbowl yesterday is it's now a 6 month plus wait for it to start again 🙄🏈 #RaiderNation

Apparently Iowa’s team won the Superbowl? https://t.co/x3yyVGwsCt
Can we have the #SuperBowl every two weeks? Despite being maxed out on steroids after chemo yesterday, I slept like a baby last night as I was up till 4 the night before #cancer
@DianaVilic @stugotmilk @adland @garyvee @VaynerMedia Enjoying your critique 👍🏻 perhaps the oddest Super Bowl activation. Especially the livestream during the actual game.
In celebration of the Super Bowl - which I slept through - we’ve got music from Shakira and J-Lo 🎧

People have been so caught up in being offended and assuming everyone appropriates culture whilst forgetting there are other cultures and people are allowed to express them! @shakira has always stuck by her heritage and she brought it at the Super Bowl! https://t.co/6UGaU41FFq

I’ve not bothered to watch any of the Super Bowl ads where they any good or just the same old overhyped, overproduced nonsense that we’ll talk about for a couple of days but will never go down in ad history?
JLo’s #SuperBowl half-time show has me in my feelings this morning Get Rught was my Year Six guilty pleasures song and I’m not ashamed to admit it 🤩
Imagine the show if @SnoopDogg @50cent @Eminem and @drdre did the @SuperBowl half time show. It would be the best one ever. It would be well worth the ticket just to see that. #SuperBowl #SuperBowlHalftimeShow #hiphop #bringthenoise

So after seeing lots of Super Bowl halftime show comments, I watched it. The sexualisation of female singers is extremely problematic. The show was very sexualised and if it hadn’t aired in the middle of the night in the UK it would likely have been considered inappropriate.

Regardless of the fact both are attractive woman I genuinely thought the Super Bowl Half Time Show was  good!

Singers alone don’t suit the occasion. You need perform!

Shakira and JLO are 43 and 50 + both mothers but my goodness 🔥💪🏻👏🏻!

 🤷🏼‍♂️ JLO didn’t perform ‘Big Booty’! https://t.co/qtw7Jvdvh5
Still my 3rd happiest Superbowl moment @JohnGonzalez 😊 ( Giants'  superbowl wins in 2011 &amp; 2008 being 2nd &amp; 1st, respectively!)

Super Bowl halftime commentary sheds serious light on social policing of women’s bodies. 

The impeccably choreo’d (@ParrisGoebel), professionally performed, and culturally significant🇨🇴🇵🇷show didn’t DaMaGe kids lmao. 

Hb conservative, slut-shaming, white-centric rhetoric tho?
Just watched @shakira and @JLo do  @SuperBowl and it was amazzzzzing in every way 🎉💗🙌🏼 #SuperBowl2020 https://t.co/LNjjsnGXxG

Way to take away the feel good factor from the Superbowl.... @ScotlandNFL  Doubt the reaction in Jacksonville will be positive leaving 6 home games - that's hardly fair on home fans https://t.co/7ZOz2poZCL

@chrissalmon I forgot you worked with Shakira as well! How many people in your line of work can say their clients are two Super Bowl halftime show artists and one of the biggest festivals in the world? Fair 👏🏻 bloody 👏🏻 play 👏🏻
@JoelHammer https://t.co/YuEH7wuXN3 thought you might like this if you haven’t seen it already.   It’s quite a long read though.
@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Quick reminder!!! Have you given his meds? Cos I am thinking you may have forgotten them on SuperBowl night - and look what happened then - master conductor lol.  On second thoughts - don’t bother with the meds .... it could be fun

If anyone is struggling to find footage of J-Lo’s performance at the Super Bowl , just find a Beyoncé concert from 10 years ago , it’s the same #SuperBowl #JLoSuperBowl #JLoSuperBowl2020

@AtomicAdMan Interesting... I didn’t interpret it as an Alzheimer’s narrative at all... for me the emotion was just that his wife had passed and regardless he was trying to deal with it and mark her memory. Nothing they said suggests it’s meant to focus on that angle! https://t.co/pmyz53JxcJ

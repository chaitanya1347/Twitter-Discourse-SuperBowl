It really boils my piss that BBC are spending licence fee money showing the "super bowl" when there are a lot of UK based sports they show no coverage of and would benefit from some TV  coverage on our so called national broadcaster 

Should be called super dull anyway

My issue with The Super Bowl is how the fuck does a 60 minute game take around 3 &amp; a half hours to complete? Absolute insanity. If you think I’m going to use it as an excuse to stay up late eating chicken wings &amp; nachos at midnight then you are absolutely right.

NFL fan Harry Kane showing once again how much he is Tottenham's MVP on #SuperBowl Sunday... #COYS
Here’s a maths puzzler, if I’ve done 5 and a half weeks of Dry January/February and start drinking when the Leicester game kicks off at 2pm, how much of the #SuperBowl which kicks off at 11:30pm will I be able to stay awake for? #lcfc 🤔 ⚽️ 🏈
The boys are gonna take a look at what they think the outcome of Super Bowl 55 will be. Starting with @JackHumphreyKM https://t.co/ls1gwMzlkI
Today will be spent almost exclusively shouting at TV for the Red Jerseys... so c’mon Cymru v Iwerddon 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿🏉 #WALvIRE  and @Chiefs in #SuperBowl https://t.co/jLq38akd6R
I should be waking up in Tampa today and it’s heartbreaking that I’m not.  Regardless, it’s unbelievable that we’re actually playing for a Super Bowl. Let’s fucking go Tampa #GoBucs
Question for all the NFL fans, who’s walking away with the Super Bowl MVP award this year? I’ve got a sneaky feeling it’s gonna be Mathieu, who you guys going for? 

@mikeviceo @ThekidEG @samuel4002AFC @GavMack23

It’s Superbowl Sunday, one of the best days of the year 👏🏻
@OsiUmenyiora the #SuperBowl is not about @PatrickMahomes @TomBrady it’s all about defence. Last time @BruceArians had a good run at super bowl @Mathieu_Era  got injured. The one player he missed is now going to come back and haunt him again. #HoneyBadger will win this game.
Have been running around Kilclief GAA pitch for the first weeks of @jog_belfast and today braved the roads with @J_Mervyn97 🏃‍♀️☔️ Probably ran off 1/5 of the amount of cake we’ve inhaled this weekend 🍰 Now for some more before #SuperBowl 🍻 https://t.co/4Us28ObVIF

Really looking forward to the Super Bowl later.

Even as a Panthers fan, I’ll still have my @tkelce jersey on.

Still can’t get over the fact that Tom Brady is playing in ANOTHER #SuperBowl at 43yrs old.

FORTY THREE YEARS OLD! 🏈

Weird seeing people dissing the 6 Nations yet staying up to watch the Superbowl when they're literally the same (not-a) sport.

also will NOT miss the Super Bowl and other sports games being so goddamn late at night. V ready to experience sports at normal times again
@94CAMRAM If you're not into American football the super bowl is a rough place to start. Maybe record it and skip through. NFL redzone on Sundays during the season is good for seeing constant action. Should be a good game tonight though
It’s SuperBowl Sunday but I’d rather be... leaving The Big House 🏢 after a Sunday Sesh... https://t.co/IX0GIXQOcO
What a weekend of sport. @CardiffCityFC picking up a win for a change, England getting beaten by Scotland, and topped with @WelshRugbyUnion beating Ireland. 

And to top it off, you've got the Superbowl tonight, meaning I get a nice early bed time! The dream.
🏈Fletcher and I are @Buccaneers fans today. Really hoping Bruce, Brady and Co can teach the @Chiefs a lesson tonight💪🏻🇬🇧 #NFLUK #NFL #SuperBowl #SuperBowlWeeknd #SuperBowlLV #TampaBayBuccaneers #KansasCityChiefs #TomBrady #Manchester @TomBrady https://t.co/qrhGS8o2PK

It’s SuperBowl Sunday but I’d rather be...in The Castle in Berlin 🍻 https://t.co/eUlOrVHCe1
In celebration of #SuperBowl my youngest son has put the two main men into art. He’s a @Jaguars fan and missed the usual games but just loves @NFL @NFLUK @neilreynoldsnfl @JasonBell33 @OsiUmenyiora https://t.co/VHm2A7tCDo
@PTP2021 @CallawayGolf @TarantoAnthony @walsallwanderer @2018Colo @AidanJudd6 Doing ok thanks guys. Looking forwards to our first #SuperBowl

Hello, I will not be watching the Super Bowl.

I will be taking no further questions at this time.
@NFL @SuperBowl who says the Americans do the super bowl best! One man show due to Covid lockdown! It won’t stop me enjoying the game! @Buccaneers for the win and @TomBrady for MVP . #englishfan #biggestsportingeventoftheyear https://t.co/9RUwEeZoT2
You tend to forget how forceful the NFL deniers are until you get to Superbowl Sunday.
Can someone book me a ticket to L.A for the Superbowl? Would appreciate that
@Susanefc09 That will be me tomorrow watching the superbowl tonight 🤦🏻🤦🏻🤦🏻🤦🏻🤦🏻
I've decided to gamble everything by getting Ridley Scott to film a one minute advert about me to be shown during The Superbowl.

It was cheaper than doing Edinburgh.
A sport packed day, improves with The Last of Us part one... Kindly recommended by my boy @AlexGelhar

Can’t wait for my yearly tradition of staying up to watch the Super Bowl, still not having a clue what’s going on, and then inevitably falling asleep because of boredom

@WHOldun1 ...you’re forgetting the @SuperBowl !! Oh yeah! 🏈🇺🇸
It looks like twitter is going to be Superbowl central for the rest of the night 😞

This must be how Americans feel when proper sports are happening in the rest of the world
Who you going for #SuperBowl @Ziggystairlift @seanayling (and any other NFL fans out there!)
@BillyIdol Oh my GOD!

we've got the Superbowl pre-show on and our pile of North American snacks ready to get us through the night however my question is why 

WHY 

is there a non-social distancy concert with Miley Cyrus happening in a whole PAINAUCHOCOLAT
It’s #SuperBowl Sunday, and in years gone by, I’d be up till 4am watching it avidly, powered by #Bud &amp; #Pizza 

Now especially, after an early, I’ll be lucky to make it to the kickoff

My money is on @TomBrady and the @Buccaneers on his 10th appearance https://t.co/Tow70rV2F8
The USA, a land of fucking spastics &amp; retards who are tonight letting 22,000 fans into a stadium in the middle of a global pandemic that is hitting them hard! These selfish &amp; irresponsible pricks will go on to infect family &amp; loved ones after catching C19 at the game. #SuperBowl
Work tomorrow morning. Alarm set for half 6. 6 red bulls. It’s Super Bowl Sunday BABYYYYY
What is this bowl of which I see many tweets and why is it super?
Over or under in the Super Bowl people?
I can’t not want Brady, Gronk and the Bucs to win the Super Bowl tonight, I like Mahomes but would love nothing more than to see the 🐐 get his 7th SB ring!! #SuperBowl
The #Buccaneers have such a slim chance of winning this game, they’d have to play a perfect game and the #chiefs would need several big mistakes. I’m taking a chiefs 32-26 win #SuperBowl
@Sonic_Sinclair I’ve got a few Kent jobs next week but booked tomorrow off so I can watch the super bowl 🏈🏈🏈

I use to be able to just book the Monday off after the super bowl now having to take two days off work just to recover as I'm old as fuck now
Superbowl day or something. I remember superbowl in Wakey. It had a Wimpy in it and i went to a few birthday parties there. They put a laserquest in it too.
Defense has already beaten #Brady once before in a Super Bowl, and I think they’re going to shut #12 down again. Having said that, stranger things have happened and if the #Bucs can get Leonard Fournette going early, they stand in gokd stead for the rest of the game. #SuperBowl
I’ll go with @TomBrady @Buccaneers @NFL @NFLUK @SuperBowl #SuperBowl #TomBrady #Buccaneers #Chiefs #ChiefsvsBuccaneers https://t.co/6riCteDZZR

Will there be a crowd at the superbowl and a half time show
World champions 😂😂😂 #SuperBowl
@BucsUK - have had a gut feeling that Gronk might have an immense game tonight . Barely targeted in the playoffs , this could be one where he is to shake things up #SuperBowl #Buccaneers
🏈 This should not go unnoticed at tonight’s game.

A massive step forwards for women in the game.

At tonight’s game the @Chiefs &amp; @Buccaneers will have more women on the field for #SBLV  than ever before 👏.

@stewartbaird688 When they played week 9??? It was 27-24 to chiefs, but buccaneers came on after half time! Also the defensive coach has never lost to Brady at Super Bowl but I think Brady has to and will know he has to throw early and run more later!
Tears for all the Patriots fans mourning Brady 🤣🤣🤣 #SuperBowl
Almost time for Superbowl 55. So excited for this one. Come on Bucs! #SuperBowl https://t.co/4xY8dgU848

Don’t even know who’s in the super bowl final, no interest at all!
@StanCollymore If the Buccaneers defence turns up it maybe a decent game! I can’t see past the Chiefs tho! #SuperBowl
I can't be bothered redoing all my Superbowl jokes. Just scroll back to last year, or the year before, or the year before that.
Won't be watching the Superbowl tonight as I couldn't get tomorrow off. Hopefully when I wake up tomorrow I can read all about a Mahomes master class.

All I could hear during #WALvIRE was the referee’s voice, almost non stop. What has the game become - now dominated by the referee practically coaching the players. Not like that in my day. Practically unwatchable now. @BBCSport 
Thankfully won’t have this at the #SuperBowl
Right that’s a cheeky bet on the game tonight! I don’t really know why I stay up for the #SuperBowl every year but hey ho! 2 top quarterbacks, one at the end of his career and one at the start, tough to call!
Root for the #Bucs just for this alone.. what a moron #SuperBowl #GoBucs https://t.co/sH3PsbdapB

@ColinMurray getting ready for SuperBowl? Confused by your comment on Fighting Talk about the early kick off! It’s almost always at 1130pm our time, the latest ever was 1140pm GMT or 640pm ET.
Has been 619pm-640pm ET every year for over 35 years now!!
Biden doesn't really come across as a football guy to me , more like baseball tbh #SuperBowl

Ya know what, I was just thinking... @NFLUK @SkySportsNFL have missed a trick on this occasion. Y'all should have (unless I missed it and you have) setup a @Twitch channel and done a watch party for UK fans and friends. #SuperBowl https://t.co/WWyB5Hf31n

The last 'neutral' #SuperBowl I stayed up for was 2014 when the Seahawks humbled Manning and the Broncos.
Watching Superbowl LV in solidarity with the Tampa wing of the family. Not sure I’ll make it to the end...! https://t.co/M292q38vKq
As always, I watch all the build up to Super Bowl and I guarantee I will be asleep before half time #SuperBowl
Right then. Coffee, @BrewByNumbers beers, @WingstopUK, several ridiculous prop bets, the GOAT vs the apprentice. It’s #SuperBowl time https://t.co/E2poL3Oxyy
@ravenslbl @Hanif_Arifi @talkchelsea @Football_LDN Super bowl #Ready https://t.co/yNuffX7Ynh
@DaveVidler @DallasStars @Chiefs Be nice for them at there stadium and they've never won the superbowl before either
Just about to get ready for the #SuperBowl and fancied a bit of retro film action so watched #theterminator - great to watch for about the 50th time. Mrs B said earlier I've never seen this, you know what's coming next then! #TheresAStormComing @Schwarzenegger @ImLindaHamilton
Congratulations on a lifetime of hard work, Sarah Thomas! #SuperBowl https://t.co/gSucP46Gns
Hopefully the colours of the champs. #GoBucs #NFLTwitter #SuperBowl #SBLV https://t.co/9TwoEO9eCK
Cannot wait for this #SuperBowl. Going to be some serious points scored tonight I think!
Couple of more betbuilders for the big game #SuperBowl 

Enjoy the game and let's hope for all the TDs. Good luck all https://t.co/JfCenTjD7E
We ready !!! #SuperBowl
Last time I stayed up for the #SuperBowl was the greatest comeback ever when the Pats beat the Falcons. No pressure guys!
Getting hyped (&amp; nervous) now...sure am worried about the makeshift offensive live but Big Red &amp; Coach Bienemy have had 2 weeks to prepare &amp; would have known about this &amp; have appropriate plans in place #ChiefsKingdom #RunItBack #SBLV #SuperBowl
#SuperBowl time 🏈🏈🏈🏈🏈
Something tells me there will be a lot of people Ill in #Tampa soon... #SuperBowl https://t.co/nbjWsNEMd5
@stevereynolds68 Been a while since I’ve watched a Super Bowl.  I’m still a bit Dan Marino and Joe Montana - Wembley 1988. Took the kids to a couple of Wembley matches seven years ago - was fantastic.  They youngest (who was 7 at the time) had no idea what was happening but enjoyed it anyway.
Half an hour until the superbowl...

Watch it every year, at home (still want to experience a night out with it), but a hotel room will have to do for this year #SuperBowlLV
Super Bowl LV time! The greatest QB of all time against maybe the greatest of the next 20 years. Should be an absolutely cracking game - very tricky to call a winner #SBLV
Apparently it's the #SuperBowl ? Has to be the most irrelevant sport in the world played in predominantly one country that everyone else finds boring
Who’s on the #SuperBowl  tonight? What’s the shouts?
Tampa Bay...Tom Brady and the Buccaneers for the win! 

#SuperBowl #TampaBayBuccaneers https://t.co/TR5CK6iUZ2
@NFLUK i'm rooting for the Bucs, cos Jason Pierre-Paul gave the Giants the best years of his career and I hope he gets a second superbowl ring - this time WITH Brady, not against him
Time to watch the #SuperBowl my money is on #KansasCityChiefs but the way my betting has been this weekend back #Buccaneers
Super Bowl snackage. Pre-game dogs and then prepping the chilli popcorn for the game. #nfl #superbowl @ Milton of Campsie https://t.co/PSZprFIshb

Bucs defence has to have the game of its life tonight, that Chiefs offence is outstanding! #GoBucs #SuperBowl
Buzzing for this Super Bowl tonight. My heads telling me Brady wins but I really like Mahomes and the Chiefs just feel unstoppable
SuperbOwl bin lid pizza ordered. There will be the traditional halftime trip outside to listen for owls. Love this game/night.
1st Baker Mayfield sighting ! I KNEW I'D SEE HIM AT THE #SuperBowl
Small nap pre #SuperBowl . Hopefully see my #Buccaneers win just their second Lombardi
#SuperbOwl https://t.co/b7NogFvnby
Everyone’s talking about Brady and Mahomes, but I’ve got my eye on Antonio Brown and Jason Pierre-Paul #SuperBowl #SBLV #KCvsTB
Can anybody honestly say they will be up for the end of the Superbowl? 🤥

Snoozefest for the halftime show 😴💤
#SuperBowl
I’m backing Brady 1 million percent, but I feel that Hill will have a big say 🐆 #SuperBowl
People are staying up to see the super bowl when there isn’t a diva playing at half time ? https://t.co/oCx8KpNj9i
Nap done. Ready for #SuperBowl but more importantly all the food @ChrisHopkins92 has prepped for the game.
I should be sat in Hooters with my mates, a huge plate of wings and a frosty jug of beer waiting for the Super Bowl kick off. Instead I’m sat at home on my own with chips and dip and a frosty bottle of sparkling water.
Strong black coffee, 1st of many I think to get me through the night! #SuperBowl #FireTheCannons #RaiseTheFlags @Buccaneers @BucsUK @NFLUK @NFL https://t.co/zHrESnjjU2

Another strong week of streaming 
Anyway another busy week of streaming starting with day 35 of the nation lockdown streams where we stream everyday during lockdown tomorrow with fifa 21 grinding and madden grinding. now to get myself ready for the superbowl let's go Brady :)
Right Super Bowl time. Expecting highscoring game with the Chiefs to sneak it #SuperBowl #ChiefsKingdom
Watching #SuperBowl for the first time and I hope it’s worth all the hype.
@neilreynoldsnfl  is this going to be the first year that Shaun isn’t going to  say that Defense wins Championships... surely it’s all about the offensive!  #SuperBowl
@nightlounge24 @BillyIdol @Valmy212 Apparently so. U watching it.   Super bowl
Super Bowl Sunday🏈!!  Who you picking? #BradyVSMahomes #TampaBayBuccaneers #KansasCityChiefs #SuperBowl #SuperBowl2021 #NFL
SuperBowl night ...
Or as any normal person would call it ...
Trailer extravaganza night 😂👍🏻
Alex from Turbo Tax YOUR THE DULLEST BITCH IN THE WORLD ! #SuperBowl 🤣
@Nicolafaddy Will like any aged ass watch the superbowl lol x
These interactive commercials are the worst ! #SuperBowl
Finkle is Einhorn, Einhorn is Finkle #SuperBowl
The Super bowl is always a good night
Heard little in the build up to the SB. About the off-season recruitment at the Bucs. There was already big talent on offensive in the skilled positions. Adding Brown, Fournette and Gronkowski. Is almost like NBA teams adding allstars  talent. 💭 Celtics 08/Heat 12. #SuperBowl
#SuperBowlSunday and when everyone else has gone to bed I’m starting my evening proper’ with the countdown to the big ballin’ and I’ve got my choice of fridge stuff stacked! #SuperBowl https://t.co/vdedampWaM
Less than an hour to stay awake to see at least the start of my first ever Super Bowl! #SuperBowl
Great fightback from P20 to P6 in F1 league. Two wins on warzone. Now the #SuperBowl 

Could this sunday get any better?
Come on @Chiefs, please don’t give that twat Brady another ring! #SuperBowl #ChiefsKingdom
The WANKIEST THING IVE EVER SEEN HAS BEEN ... the Tom Brady thing on nickelodeon #SuperBowl
Anyroad. I hate Tom f*****g Brady. But by Gad what he's done in one season getting the @Buccaneers to the #SuperBowl ... I seriously genuinely hope they win. 

*scrubs soul with wire wool*
#SuperBowl set up, Englishman style. Red Wine ✅ Popcorn ✅ Sweet &amp; Salted Popcorn ✅ @Lions lamp ✅ Mock drafting, waiting for the game ✅ As an impartial Lion, I'm rooting for the @Buccaneers #NFL https://t.co/dYNNlKFcTy
Still have no idea how American Fitba works but will still watch the Superbowl. Nae need to explain, how it works, anyone 😂
What better way to celebrate Super Bowl Sunday than by treating yourself to this incredible merch bundle from California based  @Bendu_70 🇺🇸 

There’s just 5 of these awesome merch bundles left. We would hate for anyone to miss out. ✌🏻

https://t.co/pb8eyPmd9P https://t.co/FcHHMgiy5F
made my night getting a message off @_Bailey29_ saying “can’t wait for Tom Brady to score a try in the corner to win super bowl” some bloke he is🤣
I’m not American or live in America, but if you’re being selfish and going to a super bowl party then you just suck. No wonder there’s been so many deaths https://t.co/2IelrCwSfV
@RussInCheshire @Nevfountain 1045 BBC Two. Warm up for Superbowl I hope guess &lt;snigger&gt;
We are an hour away from tonight’s #SuperBowl between @Chiefs and @Buccaneers. Who will come away with the Lombardi trophy? Brady or Mahomes? 

Check out our preview and predictions down below ⬇️😉
https://t.co/CqLFMmmUvh
A little #SuperBowl joke for you...

(It reads better if you say it out loud.)

Where are Tom Brady's Buccaneers?

On his Buccan head! ☠️
I wonder if we'll see the usual ludicrously OTT celebrations at simply winning the toss ahead of the @NFL @SuperBowl @BBCSport @NFLUK #SuperBowl
@ClutterbuckDave Excellent, just out of the bath and preparing for the superbowl. Have barleywine and cheese.
We are Super Bowl ready ❤🏈🇺🇸 #TEAMSAMJO #TheGreatShowOnEarth #SuperBowl https://t.co/tmbaRNLaJz

Was wanting to watch the Super Bowl but there’s no way. Going to bed already. When you get up at 5 I’m the morning with a baby, your hopes of watching a super bowl the next night go the way of Jared Goffs career. 😴
What a classy maiden mare Rebecca Rocks  is, foaling before the Super Bowl and producing a lovely looking colt by @DarleyStallions Blue Point for our great friends Steven and Lesley Smith and Hunscote Stud. So good to see our eldest daughter Harper in the corner assisting her mum https://t.co/kSvM3FubnP
Hoping Ray Finkle makes the kick for the dolphins tonight #SuperBowl
I know the obvious answer is to say the Chiefs will win it easily but I have a feeling that Brady can pull it off one more time. There’s been a lot of off-the-field stuff for the Chiefs this week and I wonder how much that will affect things. #SuperBowl
I am up ready(zero sleep) for #SuperBowl
Excited for SuperBowl later. Here’s hoping the Chiefs beat the Buccaneers 🤘 #SuperBowl
I WOULD WATCH THE SUPER BOWL BUT I HATE SPORTZ AS OF 18:30 TODAY
Off to chill &amp; watch the Super Bowl - enjoy the game everyone! #SuperBowl
Super Bowl has the best commercials

@DanHanzus @greggrosenthal @MarcSessler - wasn’t going to stay up for Super Bowl tonight but had to watch the @ChrisWesseling tribute with the @AroundTheNFL #heroes on @SkySportsNFL  #4heroesforever ❤️
Hasn't been a great weekend, sporting and otherwise. Hoping the #SuperBowl lives up to its name

Ok, got it.

I predict he’ll be asleep before the end of the first quarter.

Don’t think I saw the trophy presentation for my first few. 

This year is 30 yes since my first - I was just a little younger than he is. https://t.co/rIcZEks5gr

My heart says @Buccaneers but my head says @Chiefs who have you guys got? Predictions? #SuperBowl #SuperBowl2021 #SuperBowlWeeknd #SuperbowlnaESPN

So to the #SuperBowl The #NFL know how to market their brand. Might not be everyone’s cup of tea but this year all of the issues encountered , the #NFL have thrown their weight behind it, Covid, Justice, Inequality They’ve used their expertise to support these causes
Been thinking all week that I don't really care who wins this game tonight.since I've turned it on its been a total Brady suck fest &amp; it's reminded me that I really fuckin hate the smug prick &amp; i hope the buccs get absolutely pumped #notbitter 😂😂 #GoChiefs #SuperBowl https://t.co/WRV8DYOWC9
Will I be staying up for the Super Bowl? 

Absolutely not!
@NFLUK Bucs for Brady, but also to give Arians the ring he deserves. #OnePride #SuperBowl

Been on a bit of a health kick recently so took the decision not to buy the traditional #SuperBowl snacks and beers. Instead I decided to drink water and not eat anything.

90 minutes to kick off and I couldn't regret this decision any more.
@BBCMOTD Can you confirm #MOTD2 is on tonight and hasn't been lost to #SuperBowl coverage... 
That's all people want to watch tonight by sounds of it 😂🤣⚽️🏈

Despite having watched the odd game, I still don’t understand how the Super Bowl can last for so long...   Not only that, 90 mins of pre-game show crap to watch before it even starts.

Not staying up late on a Sunday for a game that’s all defence!! Tonight I’m a @Chiefs fan! #SuperBowl #Mahomes #RunItBack
I can guarantee tomorrow I'll see something about how the #SuperBowl only gets 500m viewers whereas the worldcup gets 1.1b.
This is the first time in 15 years I've not been at a Superbowl party. It's not quite the same without friends and beer.

Might not totally understand everything going on in the #SuperBowl but here’s hoping by the end of the game I will 😂
Worst thing about watching #SuperBowl on the BBC is missing out on all the US commercials.
#SuperBowl 2 commonly used words.
1, incompete
2, Super Spreader Event
What's a SuperBowl?
#SuperBowl both Os need to take a deep breath, let these defences beat themselves
No matter how hard I try I just don’t understand the #SuperBowl 😭

3. Watch Old Firm Derby

don't think anyone expected the #SuperBowl to open with back to back punts

Not watching Super Bowl as I fell out of love with the sport years ago. 

Just didn't excite me anymore.
Two punts to open up wasn't what I was expecting. Defences on top early doors #SuperBowl
#SuperBowl never disappoints with world class warbling of the US national anthem 🤷🏻‍♂️
#SuperBowl first QB to have most rushing yards?
Love watching the SuperBowl #SuperBowl https://t.co/dAoI8MnEkO
#SuperBowl let’s go!!!!! https://t.co/6TBiNEfe48
I do wonder if in 10-15 years we'll be saying the same about Mahomes as we do about Brady now. He's clearly great, but I wish he didn't win so much #SuperBowl
I love how my Twitter is full of #AdBowl with a hint of the actual football 😂😂 #SuperBowl
Aaaaaaaand here come all the super bowl tweets 😴😴😴 don’t actually see the point when no one watches American football any other time of the year 🤷🏼‍♀️🤷🏼‍♀️
Settling down for a long night watching #SuperBowl https://t.co/egDXMTJWOZ
@SamanthaQuek at least you still have @Chiefs in red to get a win for you  #SuperBowl #BucsVsChiefs https://t.co/iXnR9XswBI
Superbowl ready #SuperBowl #Jetstimenextyear https://t.co/1ENUWk0lg7
Eating chicken wings at 11.45pm can only mean it’s #SuperBowl
There’s a scary amount of people at the super bowl for a country still crippled by a global pandemic 🥴
Never been a huge fan of KCC, but will support anyone in front of Tampa Bay Bucs... for obvious reasons. #SuperBowl #MUFC #KansasCityChiefs
I’m so confused. Where even is the ball!? Rugby on steds #SuperBowl
This is like that film Tenet. Not quite sure what’s happening but watching it anyway #SuperBowl
Mahomes knew after 1 second where the space was and when to run didn’t even bother passing #SuperBowl #Mahomes
As there's fans in attendance for the #SuperBowl. This may put pressure on the #UK government to allow fans back into football stadiums? #PremierLeague #EFL #NationalLeague
Mahomes needs to speed up he’s 2 seconds too slow #SuperBowl
#SuperBowl tonight, if the bucs win, blame me, I'm off to bed and not watching, up at 4:30am for work. First superbowl in years I'm missing 😭
India v England cricket 4am, West Brom and Rangers games at 12, Wales v Ireland rugby at 3pm Liverpool game at 4.30 and now Super Bowl at 23.30 and then at 4am cricket will be back on. Oh how I love my sports 😃
Am i missing something here ? How are we in this situation we're in with continious restrictions yet in america they have fans in stadium for superbowl, Yet in UK not been able to attend a game for 12 months nearly i am puzzled ?
B1B, B2 and B52 are never observing social distancing! #SuperBowl 🙈😉 https://t.co/msnAnod2aZ
That's grounding all day long 🙄 #SuperBowl
So, here we go. #SuperBowl I know how an American must feel watching cricket 🏏 🤔
Can both of these two teams both lose! Please!!! @bbcnfl #SuperBowl
SuperBowl being filmed in 8k ?? Looks superb great depth to the image #SuperBowl
Brady Vs Mahomes! #SuperBowl https://t.co/YSTEIGpili
We drove past the Raymond James Stadium in Tampa on our way out to Clearwater so for that reason alone tonight I’ll be supporting the #TampaBayBuccaneers in the #SuperBowl 🏈🇺🇸 https://t.co/GlJ1c9EXrx
Go on #TomBrady #SuperBowl
@Kalaax008 Looks wonderful but being from the other side of the pond please can you explain Super Bowl to me,Does it mean they play with super large balls ⚽️? Or do the players need super big  balls ⚽️?
First year I’ve stayed up to watch the Super Bowl, let’s see what all the fuss is about! #SuperBowl2021
Romo is such a great analyst #NFL #SuperBowl
@MarkStevo666 @MarshallMotorGp @SuperBowl Imagine Aaron Rodgers coming to his home team niners. I'd love to see that.

It’s 2021 and I still can’t believe that the #SuperBowl isn’t in UHD/4K/HDR. Considering how early the US networks were in adopting HD, I just find it baffling! #NFL
The guys running the gimbal cameras are going to put in some yards tonight if that shot of Tom Brady is anything to go by 😂🏃‍♂️🎥 #SuperBowl #sonya1 #smsports
Ordered in cocktails for the Super Bowl. I have Donkey kicks, Long Island iced teas and strawberry daiquiri’s to see me through. Half time hotdogs with chilli cheese bites will be the food of choice.

Eighteen hours of build up (possibly) and yet Sky still nearly miss the kick off #SuperBowl
COVID day off for the superbowl is it
I appreciate my sleep more than the super bowl night
@TomBrady Make it 7 goat 🐐 #SuperBowl
I spend enough of my life getting frustrated by Kirk Cousins without listening to him talk shit about wanting a ring. Won’t happen til you retire hun. #SuperBowl

Special teams make special plays. @BBCSport #SuperBowl
Got the @SuperBowl on. They have crowds inside the stadium, something that we yearn for in football (soccer for those across the pond ⚽️⚽️) stadiums in the #UK &amp; #Europe. #SuperBowl #SuperBowl2021
The #SuperBowl is making me miss villa park even more, the noise of fans!! 😔
Superbowl underway
#SuperBowl
I think it’s my 35th consecutive #SuperBowl tonight. From the days of The Fridge, Joe Montana, John Elway &amp; the continual failure of the Bills to the domination of the Patriots...here we go. Head says Chiefs...but then there’s Tom Brady.
@markchapman welcome back to the NFL SuperBowl 👍👋✊🏈
Let's see how long into the superbowl i last.

Er, go bucks go...

Romo on comms as well 👌👌👌 #SuperBowl
#SuperBowl this is going to be good I’m going with Tampa and the GOAT Brady
@FCr_91 It’s always awful but I thought a bit more soulful than usual. @NFL seem desperate to show their (too late, not buying it) commitment to diversity tonight 🤔 #SuperBowl
Here we go!!!!! #SuperBowl
The shallow depth of field shots in the build up look great but jar when the director cuts in other cameras. Wonder when/if used for Premier League? #SuperBowl https://t.co/vRXfs5gxp4 https://t.co/dOax1ZLcHj
Still embarrassed that I thought dawn's early light was donzerly light hehe #SuperBowl
Brady to get his 7th ring #SuperBowl
Going with 34-27 Chiefs, but I'd love to see Brady upset the odds. #bbcnfl #SuperBowl
#SuperBowl ! LETS DO THIS! #NFL
When last I was watching from this side in Belfast, the NFL was tucked into a corner of a Sky Sports package. The Super Bowl tonight is on BBC1. #RunItBack

Breaking my tradition of watching the game at a different location every year.

My team deservedly isn't playing tonight, but a certain GOAT is. No surprises who I'll be rooting for tonight...

Believe. #GoBucs #NFLTwitter #SuperBowl #SBLV https://t.co/aqK6eItxT5
My team has been pretty crap in the NFL this season, but I still find myself tuning in for the #SuperBowl to watch teams I don't really give much about. This is how I see people around the world tuning in for the FA Cup Final in the 1980s, just gotta watch it. In work for 7.45 😦
I suck at betting except for getting the coin toss right in the Super Bowl.

6 years in a row.

#HeadsBaby
@JamesCoxSJ I couldn’t care who wins I just want a good super bowl🙏🏻 beer hats and snacks at the ready😂
Here we go! Mahomes madness incoming! #SuperBowl #PatrickMahomes
Here we go. Been awake since 8am and going through the #SuperBowl straight into #INDvsENG #cricket See you in 12 hours
#SuperBowl time!!! Hopefully will make it to half time, then need to avoid the result all day tomorrow til I get home from work to watch the 2nd half 😬 Not sure if it’s doable really... hoping for a #Chiefs win
Random prediction #Buccaneers for the win 
#SuperBowl https://t.co/8wkpOczdJg
Can this superbowl hurry up and start?! 

This is why American football is shit compared to actual football
#SuperBowl good luck may the best team win
Really hope that Super Bowl crowd is just friends and family because that is one big group of cosy people during a pandemic...
This man will be winning the Super Bowl with the Jags this time next year https://t.co/zk2rmbwk19
@belfastcoops 🤢🤢🤢 although a bowl of that would definitely keep me awake for the full Super Bowl!!
Can you imagine in America they only watch the FA Cup Final and THEN decide who they support?? (Until next year like X-Factor final) 
Go on Watford,  love those Hornets, Go Manchester Red Devils... ⚽️😂🤣

This is the same as these Bandwagon #SuperBowl fans over here... #HandEgg
It’s been a long tough season and it all comes down to this. Let’s go! #SuperBowl
don’t care about how the #SuperBowl pans out now after hearing someone put $30k on Tales winning the coin toss and it was Heads. Made my day/night

Brady to Gronk #SuperBowl https://t.co/m7WBWCzMKj
Expected this drive from the Chiefs, going into the 2 minute warning they needed to get something going on offence! #SuperBowl
@ffcwadey It’s bullshit. When it came over here in the 80s I worked with an American. He said you got to watch super bowl passion about it. I watched it back I. The 80s and turned over. Rather watch Aussie rules.
When it's #SuperBowl it always takes me back to playing John Madden way back when in the 90s #BBCNFL
#SuperBowl 55 👀
I’m fully expecting Kelce to score before half time now!! No way the Chiefs aren’t scoring before half time #SuperBowl #KansasCityChiefs
Brady and Gronk going old school on this #Superbowl https://t.co/Swpws3my9y
Name a better duo than Brady &amp; Gronk. #Superbowl
Posted this back in October. Look where we are now. Brady &amp; Gronk combining for two TDs in the #SuperBowl https://t.co/KGOM2gLxuT
They could always have a monster second half, but I feel KC need to score here before half time #SuperBowl
#Brady &amp; #Gronkowski are literally on another level tonight! This link up play is unreal! 🤩🏈
#SuperBowl
no Super Bowl like the SuperBowl in Mansfield amirighttt #YouStags
To think at one point Gronk looked like he was going to join WWE...he could have an MVP trophy by the end of the night. #SuperBowl
Those penalties absolutely killed the Chiefs #SuperBowl

At this rate, Rob Gronkowski is going to rip the #SuperBowl MVP title out of Mahomes’ and Brady’s hands
@TomBrady &amp; @RobGronkowski showing the @Chiefs how it's done.
@Buccaneers #offence #TomBrady  #SuperBowl
The best NFL players I’ve ever seen are winning one of my mates a Super Bowl. It’s painful to see them elsewhere but I’m buzzing for @Ed_Johns
Seen this before.... #SuperBowl https://t.co/TipFHlVbiO
@TheLondonSmoke It’s got to sting for #NewEnglandPatriots fans to see them in a different jersey linking up like this in the Super Bowl!
Get a grip #Chiefs! Stupid indiscipline. #SuperBowlLV #SuperBowl https://t.co/Tfyz22LSln
I must be the only one. Who has never been watched a min of Super Bowl. Would rather watch songs of praise
It’s 2021 and Brady and Gronk are running the show once again #SuperBowl #SuperBowlLV
The Chiefs defence. You get a penalty, you get a penalty, you get a penalty. 1st downs and 5 yards for everyone! #SuperBowl #bbcnfl https://t.co/sHHJXgy3G0
Well done for not putting your Super Bowl bet on Paul😤
All going Brady and Bucs way. Strange #ChiefsKingdom performance #Superbowl
I see the chiefs plan....win the penalties column #Superbowl https://t.co/05Czup80gv
If the Chiefs could stop finding new and exciting ways to utterly shit the bed in the second half that’d be absolutely great, thanks. #SuperBowl
Brady bunch #SuperBowl
The Brady/Gronk show. Again. Chiefs killing themselves with penalties. #Superbowl
@petejmar1975 This is the first Super Bowl where I’ve not been on nights. Normally I’m getting paid while watching this. At least I can enjoy the rum &amp; cokes.
Tom Brady and Gronk = Elite Combo #GoBucs #SuperBowl
Why didn’t we simply sign Brady and Gronk to another year and win the super bowl. Very strange!
This is so not the Chiefs, Shouldn't be nervous but littered with mistakes #SuperBowl
Brady and gronk 🔥🔥🔥🔥 running riot! Chiefs need to get going!! #Brady  #SuperBowl
Filthy #SuperBowl
GRONKOWSKI AGAIN!!! What year is this!? So many mistakes from the Chiefs! #bbcnfl #SuperBowl
Tampa went for it on 4th and Goal. Didn’t get it.
Chiefs go 3 and out. Shanked punt. Stupid pelanty by KC to give TB a reprieve.
TD TB.
Dumb dumb dumb moves from the Chiefs. They desperately need half time to regroup. #NFL #SuperBowl
MAMMA BOTHERER!!!!

GRONKED AGAIN!!!

Serious SuperBowl/American Football question, is the face paint just cosmetic or does it serve a purpose??
Anyone else having ace Ventura flashbacks @SuperBowl https://t.co/jwtjmPA8Mg
This drive by Tampa Bay needs to end in a TD, more so for the fact that the punt by the Chiefs was awful! #SuperBowl
#superbowl boys are not as excited as us https://t.co/LUy4SvrRVA
@Oli_LUFC_1919 I just want tampa to win cause it’s florida 😂 Don’t get why superbowl is all over my timeline once a year cause nobody ever watches any other nfl games. It’s like never watching football but watching the FA Cup final
@TheGlenlivet and #SuperBowl proving to be a good combination...

Kansas seem to be a little nervous. #SuperBowl
How anyone can get excited about #NFL is beyond me. #SuperBowl

That’s remarkable, three chances to score a TD from the two yard line and the Chiefs defence makes a stop 😩 #SuperBowl
What a stop! #SuperBowl
SO CLOSE #SuperBowl what a game from the buccaneers right now good defending from the chiefs
THATS A STOP!!! #ChiefsKingdom #SuperBowl
Wish that big guy had made the catch man 😂 #SuperBowl
That stop could be huge for KC... #SuperBowl
That dropped catch by Tampa on 2nd down could be costly #SuperBowl
WHAT A STOP #SuperBowl
Huge stop by the Chiefs #SuperBowl

Buccaneers started well here. Written in the stars for Brady surely #SuperBowl
Brady taking this superbowl
Chiefs haven’t got started yet! #SuperBowl

Heck we may as well get behind by double digits once more #ChiefsKingdom #Runitback #SBLV #SuperBowl
Nice to see penalties getting called against the Chiefs in a Superbowl for once 👍🏻👏🏻 #SuperBowlLV
Gees Nice route from Evans, solid throw from Brady!!! #SuperBowl
@IronWorks1983 It’s not, half the seats are cardboard cutouts that fans have paid $100 each to have their picture on. #SuperBowl
Brady | Evans.

End zone in sight. 

#GoBucs  #NFLTwitter  #SuperBowl  #SBLV
1st beer of the night. Ain't gotta go to work tomorrow for a change as I don't normally have a day off after superbowl. Come on Bucs!!
#SuperBowl
Unnecessary roughness is an actual thing in this sport? Incroyable 😆 #SuperBowl
Kansas getting piped here ... these boys better wake up or it’s finna be long night ! #SuperBowl
TB12 is slinging it so far #TB12 #SuperBowl
I'm not entirely sure what's going on but apparently someone's tight end got double-teamed? 😮😏 #SBLV #SuperBowl
Let’s go Tom Brady/Bucs 🏈

#TB12 The 🐐

I loved to go to sporting event/ cinema and sit next to a cardboard cut out be Much better than sitting next to actual human you don’t know and you know won’t like. #SuperBowl
Mad the amount of people at the Super Bowl like there’s a pandemic???
Halftime show #SuperBowl LVI please.
https://t.co/uhFs3xAQ8N
My life has changed so much. I’m watching the super bowl with a glass of red! 🤦🏾‍♂️
Enjoying the #SuperBowl on @BBCSport. Appropriately attired (@WashingtonNFL of course!) and with some #US beer &amp; snacks. Hoping for a classic! #KCvsTB #BBCNFL https://t.co/sGswnZnhct
If Brady wins he would of won more than any team #SuperBowl
Gronk from wrestling last year, to back to scoring touchdowns in the Super Bowl #SuperBowl #gronkowski #BBCNFL
Unnecessary roughness 😂😂😂😂 #SuperBowl #froots
Looks like the Super Bowl is starting. Time to go to bed before the timeline gets flooded with 🏈 tweets!
wait a minute... they're changing $100 for you to have a cardboard cutout of yourself at the match?

just when i thought stupidity couldn't reach new level, i end up seeing that 30,000 people have done that

#NFL #SuperBowl
@drdisrespect at the Super Bowl. 

Firm handshakes all around 🤝🤝🤝
Here's a mad stat
That TD pass by @TomBrady to @RobGronkowski was the first ever first-quarter super bowl TD pass of Brady's career.
#SuperBowlLV
we see you Doc!! @drdisrespect #SuperBowl https://t.co/QzGlcKNFC9
@Oldfirmfacts1 No fuckin clue what's going on. Motocross + rugby league = American football🤔 #SuperBowl
End of the 1st quarter with Tampa Bay ahead 7-3 #GoBucs #ChiefsKingdom #SuperBowl
Super Bowl capacity sitting around 1/3. Will we see scenes like this at our stadium come July/August restart??
@ibroxrocks @thisisibrox @4ladshadadream @DumGallTrueBlue https://t.co/7C4zFYc3SS
I’m sucked in to the #SuperBowl - never watched one before and I can’t help it - it’s addictive!

#TampaBayBuccaneers for the win!! https://t.co/cZ9ZuPUtoY
What is going on with the punters in this game?! #SuperBowl
Mahomes 2 out of 9 completions for 9 yards 😳 Buccs doing a good job closing down those receivers so far #SuperBowl #KCvsTB
I'm not really here for a division rival winning the #SuperBowl Come on, Chiefs, get your act together!
Bucs D getting pressure as expected and scrambling this Chiefs O. #SuperBowl #SBLV
Gosh the Super Bowl goes on forever. I could have a nap and still catch the second half. 🙄🤷‍♂️
Go Kansas go 🏈🇺🇸🌭🍺 #SuperBowl #KansasCityChiefs https://t.co/x5OiVvyE7U
the fact that there’s 25,000 people watching the super bowl actually at the stadium is mad
Brady to Gronk a long time coming and right on cue as the pundits analysed his non existent TD Superbowl history! 👀💪🏼  #SuperBowl
Go Chiefs Go!!❤💛 #SuperBowl https://t.co/AnWDm2LuX9
All the #Buccaneers have to do is beat the dutty Chiefs for robbing my @49ers boys of the #superbowl trophy last year.

Plus I don’t know how I’m going to feel if the Glazers win the Super Bowl #SuperBowl
#SuperBowl is on the way. Without the @Patriots on the game I'm supporting @Buccaneers with the #GOAT @TomBrady
Buccs need a three score lead to feel comfortable in this game. At some point Mahomes is going to throw a Madden ball. And Romo is going to predict it. #SuperBowl
O marido da Gisele Bündchen joga o Super Bowl todo ano, né?
Touchdown! Brady to Gronk! Hold on, what year is this? #SuperBowl
@r_lyndon @Broncos I bought because he was a great player and hoped he would single handedly win us a superbowl which he did 💃
It was a good start for the Sunshine Band but even though they’re behind now, they’re used to being Down Tonight #SuperBowl
Gronk gone from 24/7 @WWE champion to scoring the opener in #SuperBowl ... got to applaud it 🤣👏 #GoBucs
Wait the Superbowl is an actual game?? I thought it was like comic con for sports 🤯
I don’t get it #SuperBowl

@Thomas_NUST @premierleague Not had a repeat winner for 16 years (could happen tonight) as an example though @49ers made #SuperBowl last year and this year didn't make Playoffs
As a totally impartial, vaccinated, frontline healthcare worker who works in Wembley I hope The @FA have taken note of the crowd at the #SuperBowl when it comes to planning for the cup final 😉
@joshmeatsix why do people who have no interest in NFL watch the superbowl? 😂

#SuperBowl #dogecoin #DogeBowl
There’s an awful lot of interest in this #SuperBowl malarkey tonight. I was once lucky(?) enough to attend an #NFL game and I hadn’t the foggiest idea what was going on. Great beers in the stadium though.
TOUCHDOWN Buccs! Big Gronk! #SuperBowl
As if my dad is not only staying up to watch the Super Bowl but has bought hotdogs to have at the half time show, this man is so precious.
#Gronk #SuperBowl
Gronk to win #superbowl, and main event Wrestlemania. Legend.
Love this cake, just a pity @ChicagoBears didnt get to the superbowl for @actualmrcook birthday. https://t.co/UxDe28kOEG
Brady to Gronkowski, I am used to seeing that one... Said that a few times #SuperBowl2021 #SuperBowl #Brady #gronkowski
Glenallen Mixon with the TD, let’s go 49ers #SuperBowl #Brady #SBLV
Can not believe that is Tom Brady’s first super bowl 1st quarter TD pass ever
Gronk = Big Stonks  #SuperBowl
@AlexRafton Nice one mate! who you you got winning &amp; who do you want to win?! I’m backing @Chiefs because Brady has enough super bowl rings!
Brady -&gt; Gronk and those Patriots still haunt me. Half expecting Edelman to show up just for a laugh #SuperBowl
If its going to he that easy..   its going to he a long day for the Chiefs 🏈🏈 #SuperBowl

I’d have probably been into American Football much earlier in life but for a couple of dobbers who were big into it when in was in high school. Anyone else remember the freaks into 🏈 in school while everyone else was kicking this ⚽️#SuperBowl
Too easy that for Brady and Gronk @SkySportsNFL #SuperBowl
Looks a lot more than 22,500 at #SuperBowl !! 👏👏
No dribbling over half of USA  being in ICUs in a fortnight.  Not happening. 
#letfansin
#SuperbOwl https://t.co/b6yKWmPjXo
If the last few minutes has taught us anything, it’s that the Chiefs defence is not only able to be breached, but their holding tactics are going to be very closely scrutinised. #GoBucs #NFLTwitter #SuperBowl #SBLV
Gronkkkkk #SuperBowl
Brady 🤝 Gronk #Brady #SuperBowl https://t.co/fZ75IRz2LU
Correct decision to watch #SuperBowl on BBC - @markchapman mastering his presentation. Easy to follow, great guests.
That’s what happens when you hit your 3rd downs, take note PM from the 🐐 #SuperBowl
Some run by Fournette!!! TB having it all their own way so far!!! #SuperBowl
Well I feel this is over now! 😩🖕🏼 Fuck you Tom Brady #SuperBowl
When you get lost in the lighting section at Wilco...#SuperBowl #BBCNFL https://t.co/KucOCBcNna
Surely that’s the game #SuperBowl
Chiefs have no idea how to handle Gronk! #SuperBowl
One of the positives of weeks of insomnia - wide awake for the Super Bowl this year #stillnoideawhatshappening
OH MY FOURNETTE STRAIGHT IN FOR THE TD 👊🏻🙌🏻 #GoBucs #SuperBowl
That might be that....... And my chicken wings aren't even ready yet! #SuperBowl
Super Bowl Lenny 😳
Is that.... game? #SuperBowl
SUPERBOWL LENNY
Tampa bossing it! 4th TD! #SuperBowl

Gooooaaaaaal #SuperBowl #GoBucs
Oh no..... #SuperBowl
Never watched a #SuperBowl before but this looks so one sided it’s silly..
@TomBrady just hasn’t missed a throw..
Game over now I think. Bucs are just doing absolutely everything right so far #SuperBowl
Wow. Just wow. FOURNETTE!!!

#NFL #SuperBowl
What a block that is and Fournette runs it in!! Wow #SuperBowl
Ballgame. #SuperBowl
RUNS ALL THE WAY. TOUCHDOWN!!!!!!!!!!! #SuperBowl
Tampa Bay putting on a clinic tonight! #SuperBowl #TampaBayBuccaneers

#SuperBowl #WWE
Gronk is like a freight train when he gets going!! #SuperBowl
For too easy for the first down

Still the best Halftime Show #SuperBowl https://t.co/3tN2ymooKD
i’m yet to see a male performer/band with the exception of @brunomars. no one has entertained me at the halftime show in recent years. all my standouts have been female artists - @beyonce, @katyperry, @madonna, @shakira, @jlo, @ladygaga. #superbowl #halftimeshow #theweeknd
#SuperBowl #HalfTimeShow was amazing
That half time show was dreadful glad i only care about the game! Lets go Bucs! #NFL #SuperBowl
My other thought watching the #SuperBowl halftime show is we better get an epic set for #WrestleMania this year, especially given the large wall we got in NJ two years ago. You’ve made a stupid amount of money Vince, get Dunn to blow some of it on a great set! 😂 #NFL #WWE
#snow #leighonsea #StormDarcy #uk #SuperBowl #TheWeekend Watching Super Bowl and the snow fall!! Great half time show this year! https://t.co/jY8Izlqsru

I’m going to sleep. Another Super Bowl and another game where Brady has paid off the refs. And people try and convince me American sports aren’t rigged...
Blinded by the Lights is a certified banger #blindinglights #SuperBowl
Watching US coverage of the SuperBowl with their ad spots is just another experience altogether.
Not a statistician but I'm sure that's Mahomes first or second game without a TD in the first half. #BBCNFL #KCvTB #SuperBowl #NFLTwitter
I do have to say though that  these adverts during the Superbowl are amazing.
Brady’s thrown 50 touchdowns this season. Only Kurt Warner’s thrown 49 touchdowns (inc postseason) and won a Super Bowl. Brady is 43! 

Let that sink in #SuperBowl 
@NFLUK
I don’t know who need to hear this but Tampa Bay Defence got MaHomes on lock... not ref flags.. If MaHomes the modern day goat time to shine! #SuperBowl
Why did I pick KC for the Superbowl? It’s like watching Hunslet #jinx

not saying the Weeknd didn't put on a great show because he did BUT starting a petition for a Rock/Metal band next year, @slipknot for the #SuperBowl ?! 😂🤘

for a halftime show during a pandemic imma give @theweeknd props for doing something creative, innovative and unique to other covid era performances. however last years one entertained me more! #superbowl #halftimeshow #theweeknd
Devin White is scary good.. #athlete #SuperBowl
Think I prefer the half time penalties between Ryehills and Huntcliffe at the Riverside Stadium. Just saying. 🥱#SuperBowl
Saw this on my stream. Craziest #SuperBowl ad ever. Definite slice of the future... https://t.co/WWYee0hzOX
I’ll give The Weekend a 6/10 for his HT show but @ChrisHopkins92’s HT pulled pork and corn was a solid 9/10. Living our best #SuperBowl life. https://t.co/uoK3lMAEyI
Wonder if there's any way out of that 10 year contract for Kansas City.... #Mahomes #IsHeAllThat #SuperBowl #KCvTB
I mean the half time show is always a big thing, Twitter don’t shut up for a start off.. and it’s something to look forwards to. But that was just meh 🤷‍♂️ My feed seems pretty quiet aswell 😕 #SuperBowl #TheWeeknd
Probably the worst half time show ever in the @NFL Super Bowl. If I was @theweeknd I would ask for my $7 million back
If you didn’t like the #HalfTimeShow of #SuperBowl then don’t fret the Futures are green.

#SuperBowlLIV https://t.co/sAP90bphAW
@theweeknd Smashed it!! 👏🏽👏🏽 #SuperBowl
I mean I've laughed at the Chiefs a lot in the first half but they came back from 20-10 to win 31-20 with about 7 minutes left last year, so this is far from over #SuperBowl #BBCNFL
The Weeknd surpassed my expectations. #SuperBowl
Half time for Super Bowl LV. Not funny when it’s 1:45am and I’ve work in the morning. Or, more accurately, later today. #shouldhavebookedthetimeoff
Listen @Chiefs - see if you can shove this 28-3 chat up Tom Brady’s ass, us #Falcons fans will never forget your charity #NFL #SuperBowl
Best half time show ever, fuck everything that's came before it and everything that'll come after it..... #SuperBowl
Second half starting! Southern fried chicken tenders in the oven! #SuperBowl #allaboutthefood
More of the same please Tampa! #GoBucs #SuperBowl
NFL: fans in the stadium must be limited in numbers due to covid 19

The weekend: leave it with me, here's a red shirt some lights, just march. I can get you all in

Chiefs need a touchdown to start this second half or the game is probably gone for them. Tom Brady is just too good and proving once again that he's the GOAT

#SuperBowl #Brady #BBCNFL
Not sure who’s performing better at the superbowl? @TomBrady or @theweeknd both rocking the place so far tonight!! #SuperBowl #wheresmahomes #BBCNFL
If #mahomes doesn't lead KC to a TD on this first drive then it's likely #Brady's night

#SuperBowl
Tenia la esperanza de que saliera mi Diosa la Rosalia con the weekend en el show de medio tiempo y asi quede 🤡  #SuperBowl
Now, here's hoping for a cracking second half #SuperBowl
That was a good halftime. Little shaky at beginning but got better and better. Loved the visuals and the stage. #TheWeeknd #HalfTimeShow #SuperBowl
@sammfirth_ What were the other 3 #SuperBowl
Superbowl is shit and a having a huge half time show is incredibly tinpot.

Imagine Little Mix coming out to sing and dance to a few songs at Wembley at half time of the FA Cup 😭

@nbcbrooklyn99 how did the Pontiac bandit manage to do the superbowl halftime show?

Well that half time show was on a par with The Chiefs 1st half performance #SuperBowl
Me: "There is nobody I would be more annoyed about winning the Super Bowl than Tom Brady."

Brady: "RELEASE THE GRONK"
Watching my first #SuperBowl in about 30 years and loving it! Great laughs in the studio 🙌 #BBCNFL

.@theweeknd - class. #SuperBowl #SBLV
Anyone explain why during a global pandemic, a random music person has lots of backing dancers not adhering to social distancing requirements during the #SuperBowl half time show??
So one song nowadays gets you a #SuperBowl HT Show gig #justsaying
The Weeknd crushed it. Best halftime show since Gaga 🤩 #blindinglights #SuperBowl
@thejaketravis Guess that’s What happens when it’s in Tampa mate, also they will never give a call against Brady in a Super Bowl
C'mon Chiefs make a game of it💪🏻🏈🍺 #SuperBowl
Best superbowl half time show since Coldplay
#SuperBowl
So far The Weekend had a better 1st half than the Chiefs #SuperBowl
Haven't seen that many red shirts running around a pitch aimlessly since we played Arsenal last Tuesday 

#SuperBowl
That half time show did nothing to help keep me awake 😂😴 #SuperBowl
He only got the halftime show because of #blindinglights but we will let him have his moment 👏🏼 #TheWeeknd #SuperBowl
That was incredible @theweeknd #SuperBowl
Most people: Blinding Lights is a song people danced to on TikTok

Me: it was the theme song from last year's WrestleMania

#PepsiHalfTime #SuperBowl #SBLV
Man Put up 7mill of his own money to put up that shit #SuperBowl
Man like The Weekend must have got paid bags upon bags upon bags for that Super Bowl ting
@SkySportsNFL some of these calls are so soft, why are they calling these when last week in the championship games they weren’t flagging anything. It’s the Super Bowl, let them play surely.
Penalties - Kansas City Chiefs 95 - 5 Tampa Bay Bucks. Need to clean that up if they’ve got any plans of a comeback in the second half. With Mahomes on the field, anything is possible though! #SuperBowl
That was the worst #SuperBowl halftime show I’ve ever seen 🤦‍♂️ Bring back the Latino gang!
Well, that was absolutely fantastic. #SuperBowlWeeknd #GoBucs   #NFLTwitter   #SuperBowl   #SBLV #TheWeeknd

That halftime show was so fucking good.

Well that was shite #SuperBowl
Forgettable from #TheWeeknd #PepsiHalftime #SuperBowl
I think #TheWeeknd has just secured his concert in my head with that epic half time show 👋👋 #SuperBowl #SuperBowlLV
Mahomes to mount a comeback? #SuperBowl
That was actually pretty good. #HalfTimeShow #SuperBowl
My guy has bangers, I can’t believe they gave this show to Maroon 5 and Travis Scott two years ago #SuperBowl

Seen this guy live.Had remained buried until just now. #HalfTimeShow #Flashback #SuperBowl https://t.co/Xg2JKYmL7H
Twittah moaning that it isn’t some aging rocker… We had a decade or so of “safe” rock acts after the wardrobe malfunction. I don’t mind more modern acts. I am not the target audience. I watch regardless of who is doing the half time show. #NFL #SuperBowl
Loving the halftime entertainment at this years #SuperBowl
The creative direction is dope 🔥🔥🔥 #TheWeeknd #SuperBowl
Absolutely class that by the weeknd 🙌🏼 #SuperBowl
Unreal from @theweeknd 🙌🏻 shame there’s hardly any fans there to see it #SuperBowl
Pretty sure a Siouxsie &amp; The Banshees song hasn’t been sung at a Super Bowl before. #happyhouse #SuperBowl
This is very ‘US’ isn’t it? Is that intentional? #SuperBowl
@Ziggystairlift What? For punters? Tampa are having fun! #NFL #SuperBowl
They’re trying to beam him up, but there’s interference  #SuperBowl
The best Super Bowl halftime show. https://t.co/P6mPMVZmu2

I can't be the only one who thinks Blinding Lights is a fucking awful song, surely? Honestly, every time I hear it the radio gets muted. #SuperBowl
I hope @siouxsieandtheb and Steve Severin get some cash from @theweeknd dropping Happy House into his #SuperBowl half time set.

Another #superbowl half time show that’s a whole load of meh. They hit the spot (or nearly got there at least) with Beyoncé, Katy Perry, Bruno Mars and Shakira/J-Lo, but Coldplay, Justin Timberlake are sub 6/10 half time shows. And let’s not get me started on Maroon 5’s...
#SuperBowl worst half time show ever
What is going on, is this the new chiefs defence coming into the field or something 🙈 #SuperBowl
Butlins redcoats rocking the #SuperBowl https://t.co/rWfuWvncle
Okay this is quite good tbf. Maybe I should listen to some of The Weeknd’s music sometime. 😊 #SuperBowl #HalfTimeShow
By the looks of it the biggest winner at #SuperBowl is COVID-19
#SuperBowl let them play!
And the Grammy snubbed  this guy 🙄😅😂 #SuperBowl  #TheWeeknd 👏🏾
Never wanted The Weeknd to finish as much as I do now. #SuperBowl
Pues bastante malo el #HalfTimeShow , de lo más equis que han hecho en los últimos años...

A #TheWeeknd le quedo grande el #SuperBowl
Halftime show is just awful #SuperBowl
Big second half for the Chiefs! Do they have an answer for the fast, strong and ferocious Buccs D-line? Also less penalties might help 😏 #SuperBowl
BUT ARE THEY WEARING JOCKSTRAPS ON THEIR HEADS?! #SuperBowl  #bucs #Chiefs #TheWeeknd https://t.co/hP2H2unl7y
Still love this! #SuperBowl https://t.co/fwMPLBoZOb
I’m really enjoying The Weeknd’s performance so far! #SuperBowl
Man are performing with underpants on their heads  #SuperBowl
Wide awake 😞 I guess there’s always the super Bowl!
Abel 🤝 superbowl
The Weeknd has absolutely smashed that, unreal performance 🔥 #SuperBowl
Piss poor half time show this. I'm bored #SuperBowl
Prince will forever have the best Super Bowl half-time performance. Tell me I'm wrong #SuperBowl
Every year I watch The #SuperBowl and every year I don't understand it.
I really just don’t know ? 🤔 #TheWeeknd #SuperBowl
Can’t listen to “Earned It” without thinking about Christian Grey and his red room #SuperBowl
The weekend can't end soon enough #SuperBowl
If you liked KC -3 you gotta love them  +7.5 #SuperBowl #mahomes

Who booked the ally pally sound engineer for half time? #SuperBowl
Of course I had to watch Superbowl ❤️ #SuperBowl https://t.co/TCQgSfA6c6
I got worried for a moment, i thought i had a power cut like the City of Edinburgh earlier tonight, but i realised its just that this Half Time show is a bit shit

#NFL #SuperBowl #SuperBowlWeeknd
If there's one thing this performance is reminding me, it's that I know a lot more of The Weeknd's songs than I thought!

And his microphone could be better...

#PepsiHalfTime #SuperBowl #SBLV
Well must be my age but this has to be worst super bowl half time show I ever seen. Who is this fella, looks and dresses like an older Michael Jackson
He bringing Drake out or what ??? #SuperBowl #SuperBowlWeeknd
Jeez this half-time show is dire. Couldn't they at least have got someone a little bit more famous? Bored bored bored bored bored. If The Weeknd was on the radio I'd turn the volume off. #SuperBowl
As much as i love the weeknd nothing will top Princes half time show #SuperBowl
#SuperBowl https://t.co/AOSbU2egFE
Probably the worst half time of a SuperBowl ever #SuperBowl
It’s great that @K1 is doing the halftime show at the #SuperBowl 🤣🤣 Not even Mahomes is that versatile.
Chris Kamara did a great job at #SuperBowl #HalfTimeShow https://t.co/QPJLkJNTIu
Damn, I forgot how many hits #TheWeeknd made, this guy is a damn good performer #SuperBowl
Where’s Janet Jackson when you need her #SuperBowl
If Drake headlines a SuperBowl halftime show I would love him to fly out the British Grime acts he's been cosying up to, to feature, because that would be huge
The Weeknd with banger after banger on #PepsiHalftime #SuperBowl #GoBucs
As an aside, some the cameras (&amp; camerawork) in the game coverage are insane.  NFL, not for the first time, leading the way... 

#SuperBowl
the day the champions league or world cup final has a half time show is the day is stop watching football #SuperBowl
I’ve stayed up to watch #TheWeeknd who I absolutely love, but they need to sort out the sound at the Super Bowl half time show, can hardly hear him! #SuperBowl #HalfTimeShow
One day in February soon enough Tom Brady will finally be finished and I’ll finally be able to the enjoy Super Bowl. Every year, I hope, and one year soon enough my dreams will come true until then well played Tom, you have sucked the life out of me for too long.  #bbcsuperbowl
A lot of people are shitting on the super bowl half time show but I enjoyed it good performance from the weekend
Thats Tom Bradys greatest ring beating Brees Rodgers and Mahomes along the way #SuperBowl
Unbelievable. Simply unbelievable. 

🐐 🐐 

#SuperBowl https://t.co/7YLXSRiPCu
@DevinWhite__40 for MVP #SuperBowl
@seidodge That play was nearly one of the greatest Superbowl moments ever
Question for #BBCNFL @markchapman @OsiUmenyiora @JasonBell33 @Carlsonsports 

Who would win if you swapped the QBs around? #SuperBowl
@AntoineWJr11 just ruined it for his whole team by being a total twunt. Not cool seeing the level of brutality that @PatrickMahomes has had to put up with, either. @TomBrady getting his 7th and @theweeknd’s performance have been the most memorable things about #SuperBowl #bbcnfl
Tyreek is fucking outstanding, but my god, this is fucking ultimate shithousery, and i’m here for it. #SuperBowl https://t.co/LjNBfFGXG9
I know he is getting well beaten - but Patrick Mahomes is an unbelievably talented Player  #SuperBowl
This has been Brady’s easiest Super Bowl win by far.
I think I’ve done more yards getting beers from the fridge than the Chiefs have all night! @BBCSport #BBCNFL #SuperBowl
@BBCSport @BBCOne @JasonBell33 @markchapman @OsiUmenyiora As Osi always says defence wins you championships. #BBCNFL #Mahomes and #Chiefs have been poor. Great coverage of The #SuperBowl as always see you next year. The Goat making it number 7 🐐
His team’s been well beaten by a better team featuring the G.O.A.T... however, the fight and resilience by Mahomes to keep going, down this much and clearly with a debilitating injury is just incredible and shows why he’s gonna be in plenty more Super Bowls👏🏈 #NFL #SuperBowl https://t.co/6eHc0h4Rol
Put some respect on Todd Bowles name! If he can’t get a HC role on a top tier team you know what it is.. MaHomes will be back. FYI TB defence &gt; Tom Brady #SuperBowl @FirstTake @ESPNNFL
They will all talk about Brady but the bucs defence has been sensational #SuperBowl
This one's over. Dominating performance from the Bucs defense, but this game has been a disappointment after all the pre-game hype #SuperBowl
If I'd have gone to bed at half time Chiefs would be back in this. Not the game I expected. Bucs have killed it #SuperBowl #BBCNFL
Bold of Robinhood to air a commercial during a super bowl with so many suss calls
Patrick Mahomes taking a frightening amount of hits in #SuperBowl 
JPP and Suh have been immense
Immense.

#SuperBowl https://t.co/KIrOg875C1
TB have been exceptional in all phases, thoroughly deserved this, Defense has created chaos which even Mahomes has been unable to overcome (receiver drops etc). #SuperBowl
Tampa Bay are going to do it! The Buccaneers are going to win the SuperBowl! 

2 championship teams in Tampa and a Finalist team that just fell short! What a time if you are a sports fan Living in Tampa Bay! Incredible
I can't decide if this is better or worse than Superbowl 53 between the Patriots and Rams #NFL #Superbowl
Top Shithousery there from Winfield 😂😂 cracks me up how they get all serious about it “don’t condone that at all!” Behave! #SuperBowl
#SuperBowl has been mad
Winfield took that personally🤣 #SuperBowl https://t.co/CVVP9TZUMj
@Buccaneers DEFENCE #SuperBowl @NFLUK https://t.co/0v3wEceLbu
Why do Americans have such a problem with taunting? If anything I want to see.more of that type of thing! #SuperBowl
The line is the other way #Mahomes. Will someone protect him? #SuperBowl #SuperBowlLV
This Tampa Bay group manages to make New England look nice 
#SuperBowl
My highlight of the Superbowl! https://t.co/8Vxg0mGczk
Mahomes now knows how thanos did when the avengers jumped him #SuperBowl #beatup
7!!! 🐐 #SuperBowl #Bucs #brady #Bradygronk #nfl
3rd &amp; 33??? Is that the longest play ever in the @NFL #SuperBowl #BBCNFL
Does that streaker not know some of us have work in 5 hours &amp; need some sleep #SuperBowl
Top stuff again on Super Bowl night from Osi, JBell, Mike and Chappers. In the words of Tony Romo “Great Job” #BBCNFL
Have to give credit to Todd Bowles and the Tampa Bay Bucs defence for making Mahomes and the KC offence look average. The Bucs offence have done what's needed. Brady will get the all credit. But the old saying defence wins championships. #SuperBowl #KCvTB #NFLTwitter
Yoooo Mahomes getting rocked #SuperBowl
Brady’s last two Super Bowl wins (including tonight), have been complete duds. Not that it matters to Pats or Bucs fans. #NFL #SuperBowl
Todd Bowles the greatest defensive coach since Villa’s #JohnTerry ❤️🏈 #BucsVsChiefs #SuperBowl
Not watching  the presentation.  No cares that I'm not but thought I'd say so anyway . Worst Sb since , oh wait Brady was involved  #SuperBowl
@swsportsnews With you on that! Looking forward to @marmite toast and a double espresso #SuperBowl #ENGvIND to follow! #lovesport
CLOBBERED!!!! #NFL #SUPERBOWL

Let's see if KC can actually get a TD....
#BBCNFL the Chiefs are set to be the first team since the Dolphins in Superbowl 6 fail to score a touch down.
"Toto, I've a feeling Kansas aren't going to win anymore."

#SuperBowlLV #SuperBowl #wizardofoz #wizardsoftampa #Buccaneers #NFL https://t.co/fxFCw0VRMD
Mahomes has been absolutely battered tonight by this Bucs defence! #GoBucs #SuperBowl
cant believe how dominant Tampa have been this entire game! #SuperBowl
Bucs didn’t do anything wrong.. chiefs just didn’t turn up however Mahomes was let down badly tonight #SuperBowl #ChiefsKingdom
Damn Suh just knocked Mahomes into the middle of next week!! 😬 #SuperBowl
Five from glory. #GoBucs #NFLTwitter #SuperBowl #SBLV
It is no myth that a great defence wins the Superbowl!
#TampaBayBuccaneers
Wasn’t even a good streaker #SuperBowl https://t.co/YiNnUJmgK2
Why does the Super Bowl go on for fucking ever? And I still have no clue what is going on. #dontget cricketeither
So that’s how the NFL get another ad break in #SuperBowl 

Very clever 😂
#Mahomes raging that a fan invading the field got more rushing yards than him.
#SuperBowl
@NFL
Master class from the @Buccaneers their defence was unreal #SuperBowl #Chiefs #Buccaneers
The fan on the field is giving me 2020 vibes #SuperBowl
@KCChiefs_UK Watching on zoom with the group I always go away with for Super Bowl weekend which includes 2 Bucs fans. I got to enjoy it last year, they’ll enjoy this. We’ll be back
Me trying to see what happened to that fan who ran on the pitch

#SuperBowl #SBLV
 https://t.co/eKF3eWxCTf
Reduced crown capacity yet a streaker still appears 😂🙃 #SuperBowl
Pretty sure the streaker made more yards than the chiefs #SuperBowl
Bloddy pitch invader delaying how soon I can go to bed 🤣🤣 #BBCNFL #SuperBowl #SuperBowlLV @SkySportsNFL @NFLUK
They turned the camera away when a fan invaded the pitch at Super Bowl. That sort of thing is always fun to watch but we didn’t get to see it. The fan is an idiot though.
Rush hour traffic at Oxford Circus has more yards than Kansas City tbh #SuperBowl
I honestly can’t believe the Chiefs haven’t scored a touchdown yet.... #SuperBowl
Streaker. Lol. #SuperBowl
The #Browns would've given the #Bucs a better game tonight #SuperBowl
#SuperBowl https://t.co/lsQczDV6UO
Brady thinking this most interesting to happen on Kansas offence all game #SuperBowl
Seems the fan on the field has made more yards tonight than the Kansas City Chiefs. 

#GoBucs  #NFLTwitter      #SuperBowl #SBLV
The pitch invader at the Superbowl got more running yards than the Chiefs have all game #signhimup #SuperBowl #KansasCity
That fan made more yards than Chiefs have tonight #SuperBowl
That pitch invader has just covered more ground than the chiefs tonight. #SuperBowl #BBCNFL
Hahahahaha yup that’s a new one, not seen a streaker in the #SuperBowl before 😂
Annoying that I decided to sleep through the first half of this Super Bowl.
Game over
Too little too late! Garbage time padding!! #SuperBowl #BBCNFL
Good old Tight Ends #SuperBowl https://t.co/qDIrQWZG9i
Rota gods conspire to make the covid rota extra ortho night on-call @RoyalLondonHosp Super Bowl night thank you! 🙏#Superbowl #orthotwitter #orthopaedics

It’s a sporting marathon.  Up at 6am on Sunday for the cricket which is going well.  Still up watching the @SuperBowl history being rewritten by Brady.  And sandwiched in the middle a @WelshRugbyUnion win and a @ManCity win. Top day but very tired now 💤 @ECB_cricket
@YaniOurabah Won’t be his last superbowl we good
@craigfowler86 Similar to Washington in Super Bowl 18 which was the first one held in Tampa. Went in as reigning champs and looked unstoppable all year only to run into a Marcus Allen buzzsaw.
@RodArmitage @christhefa Tom Brady will have more Super Bowl rings than Jason Pierre-Paul has fingers!
Tony Romo on comms: “It’s not over yet”
Yes Tony, it really is!
#SuperBowl
Would've gone for on 4th down there... #SuperBowl #TampaBayBuccaneers
Honestly just want to go to bed, but with my luck, I'll wake up to the Chiefs winning the Super Bowl thanks to a stand in QB performance by Les Dennis.
Chiefs can't deal with the Buccs running game #SuperBowl
@Tim_Mc_Garry @SuperBowl I reckon Gregory is only tuning in for the half time show.

Ah... erm...

Mahomes’s body was parallel with the ground when he made that throw. #SuperBowl

#SuperBowl https://t.co/3EwnMGIivx
This Super Bowl feels like a timely reminder to shift resources from linebacker and safety to the OL &amp; DL...
Honestly I could listen too @tonyromo commentating forever #SuperBowl #BBCNFL
Who wins MVP and why is it Tom  #Brady ? #SuperBowl
What Mahomes has had to put up with in this game is making Russell Wilson's experience post Super Bowl 49 look like a sedan chair ride. https://t.co/APskNoRXKf
. @funksoulHulk if we're allowed out next year for Superbowl, and if Brady is there... let's strike a deal that we get so smashed we don't even remember it! 😂
I'm loving watching the Chiefs get hammered. Hilarious. About time someone wiped the smile off Kelce, Mahomes and Matheiu's smug faces. #SuperBowl
Mahomes is getting nothing. #SuperBowl
Yes, I bought a first class ticket to the band wagon. Watched my first #Superbowl, and am already looking forward to picking a team to support.

I have a shortlist.......
@NFL how do I vote for Tampa Bay defence for MVP #SuperBowl . Shaw Barrett or JPP @CBS #NFL #MVP @espn
Now if that had been caught... #SuperBowl https://t.co/yPY7JUonG8
Bucs pounding the Chiefs with the run game and eating up the clock. #SuperBowl
Imagine the score if The Chiefs receivers could actually catch something.
Mahomes's talent being wasted here ...
#SuperBowl #SBLV
The fact the Chiefs D have managed to win a game for a team they don’t play for, they all deserve the MVP in my book! #NFL #SuperBowl
Kansas City should have played some actual NFL players at tackle rather than the two turnstiles they put out tonight imo #SBLV #SuperBowl
@ChrisRolfe16 @sportbible Feel for you buddy. I did that for the Pats V Rams super bowl and I think that was possibly the worst decision of my life
@JoshMacuga @KenNapzok @MrsJoshMacuga Here’s me thinking that ‘turf toe’ was a fictional thing created by #theafternoons and Mahomes is actually suffering with it in #SuperBowl Colour me an idiot 😂

Thought this one would be a classic. Shame it’s so one-sided #SuperBowl #SBLV
Run. That. Clock. #NFL #SuperBowl #Buccaneers
Brady is going to have more Superbowl wins than any team has. Insane. #SuperBowl #BBCNFL
This has been Mahomes vs Tampa - he’s had no help whatsoever tonight from his Chiefs teammates. 

#SuperBowl
Mahomes literally backpedaling 20 yards with several guys bearing down on him and he’s throwing no look DIMES, he’s completely different class 
#SuperBowl
Hating the Tampa Bay Officials  (I mean Bucs,) but man can the KC receivers catch the damn ball. Patrick is balling on one leg #Mahomes #SuperBowl
Mahomes produced magic and yet again his players fail him, #ChiefsKingdom tanked from the off, #TampaBayBuccaneers had them from the off, Brad has still got in in spades Mahomes needs his players to step up #SuperBowl
Question is, do I now push on and watch the start of the cricket?
#SuperBowl
Mahomes struggled tonight and it’s all down to this Bucks defence! He will be having nightmares for a few weeks after this #SuperBowl
Some of the throws Mahomes is able to make is unreal. His wide receivers letting him down tonight. That's twice it's hit their face masks #SuperBowl
Has to be over now, if the Chiefs had got a touchdown there then maybe that might have rallied them for a comeback. Shame this has been such a walkover. #SuperBowl
That would have been the best pass I'd ever seen. Like Nolan Arenado! #bbcnfl #SuperBowl
Time for my traditional ‘not watching any more of this shit’ tweet #SuperBowl #NightAll
I actually feel sorry for Mahomes #SuperBowl
Patrick is literally trying create magic but no one wants it in his receiving corps 😭😭😭 #SuperBowl
Give the Superbowl MVP to the TB defense. Absolutely brilliant from them, so much pressure on Mahomes. Terrific coverage on Hill. What a perfect execution of their gameplan
Fair fucks to Mahomes. 2 accurate tosses while falling and being rushed. Both agonisingly close to TDs - warrior 👏🏻 #Mahomes #SuperBowl
@kritimant He is, GOAT definitely is - just un-FUCKING-believable, fantastic. What a game, did lie this is my twenty-fifth Superbowl miss you JRO 😘
#SuperBowl https://t.co/kuXtaKeHZ7
Mahomes extending the plays under so much pressure is great to watch. #SuperBowl
What a defense #TampaBayBuccaneers #SuperBowl
Receivers giving mahomes absolutely nothing.. shows how good the bucs defence has been. #SuperBowl
Mahomes with B2B greatest throws of all time #SuperBowl
Think Kansas City need to get themselves some decent o-liners quite urgently or Mahomes is getting Andrew Luck’d 
#SuperBowl
Another one hits in the middle of the face mask. Good god make some plays @Chiefs your QB is doing stuff no one ever has in a Super Bowl &amp; you’re literally dropping the ball.
Jesus, Mahomes going down fighting here. How on Earth has he thrown that last one as he’s horizontal to the ground 😂😂 #SuperBowl
Patrick Mahomes' ability to get the pass off – albeit with no little risk attached – while scrambling, falling, whatever, is unreal. #SuperBowl
HOW MANY TIMES HAVE CHIEFS PLAYERS HAD THE BALL HIT THEM RIGHT IN THE FACE MASK OR DROPPED CATCHES TO HANDS!!!! ✋🏼🖕🏼😩 #SuperBowl
Patrick Mahomes is scrambling for his life right now and his team mates aren’t helping him out #SuperBowl #SBLV
Mahomes has been so let down by his receivers in this game wow #SuperBowl
Wow. I mean, WOW. #SuperBowl
How good is Patrick Mahomes!!! #SuperBowl
I FUCKING LOVE @DevinWhite__40 GET FUCKING LIVE #GetLive45 #GoBucs #SuperBowl
Ok maybe it’s over now... #SuperBowl
Mahomes must be absolutely fuming at his reciever there! He's thrown it when he's basically horizontal. You've got to make that catch! #SuperBowl #BBCNFL
Turnover on downs! This Bucs defence has been outstanding the entire game! 👏🏻 #GoBucs #SuperBowl
Mahomes clearly carrying an injury but you can’t take away the performance of this Tampa Bay defense. Pressured him all night and superb in the secondary and in the corners #Buccaneers #SuperBowl #KCvsTB
Mahomes ability to throw the ball off balance is fucking outrageous. #SuperBowl
#FinsUp 😎 #SuperBowl
Is that the ball game do we think? TB turns it over on downs??? #SuperBowl
Me when I lose my mum at the shops #SuperBowl https://t.co/HaxrBKOLf2
Chiefs all over the place #SuperBowl
Mahomes is struggling here but what a fighter, he just never gives up. Some crazy good throws here #SuperBowl
So much build up about how Patrick Mahomes would test our defence - he’s been taken out of the game from the first minute. A defensive masterclass of the highest order. #GoBucs  #NFLTwitter     #SuperBowl  #SBLV
That’s the game surely but how the hell has Mahomes got that away #BBCNFL #SuperBowl
Mahomes is playing "Run Rabbit"! #NFL #SuperBowl
yooooo can any of the KC team catch?? #SuperBowl
#SuperBowl unluuuuuuucky
#SuperBowl 4th quarter... game is over but I have a bottle of wine to go... no work tomorrow... stick or twist?
If it wasn't for Patrick Mahomes, I'd say it's the Bucs superbowl.
I certainly wasn’t expecting this score line at kickoff...

How annoying is it that everyone in the AFC spends the entire season getting domainated by the Chiefs only for them to turn up to the super bowl and play like this

#SuperBowl
@NOWTV Any idea why my internet frequently disconnects and becomes unreliable around 2 in the morning? Not an issue normally but now I’m in the dog house due to it happening during the Super Bowl.
@BBCSport #bbcnfl I’m watching my first Super Bowl&amp; tipped GOAT Brady to out play the young pretender. Is this score caused by Tampa forcing the Chiefs to hustle and disrupt their play or by the penalties conceded?

If you'd have said - at the start of the game that, nr the end of the 3rd quarter, it would be 4TD to 0, you'd have thought Mahomes, right?

@garypatchett Yes, but you're forgetting the drop down charge double-back single attack plays. Never discount those.

@_cafitchick_ Super bowl I'd say super bot babe ❤
Not sure about the refereeing though... #SuperBowl
If this #SuperBowl goes the way it looks to be going, that secures #TomBrady as one of greatest Sportsman of all time? NFL fan or not his achievements are unquestionable #GOAT #TomBrady  #Brady
Oof just #SuperBowl
Any time I hear a fog horn now all I can think of is... #SuperBowl https://t.co/7IFcdiy90s
‘Where tf is KC’s defence’ #SuperBowl #SuperBowlWeeknd https://t.co/7L41ssoaKV
Every year I try so hard to stay awake past the half time show and every year I fail. Maybe next year 🤞🏻 #SuperBowl
Nobody

Brady 🗣️ THREE NINETEEEEN!!!

#BBCNFL #SuperBowl https://t.co/chqyGevfZ5
My (very) early prediction for Super Bowl LVI was going to be a TB-KC rematch, but the NFC will undoubtedly be stronger next season. GB will reload, Rams are now a serious threat with Stafford, the 49ers will be healthy again. Still fancy Brady to get his 8th though. #NFLTwitter https://t.co/s35ZcHYHSO
One day, Gods Plan and with his blessing I shall be able to go watch a super bowl at a stadium
Apologies to the GOAT for all my years of hatred #SuperBowl #TomBrady https://t.co/EQq4t1kf6C
OK #SuperBowl down but I'm still going for #INDvENG
u either understand the super bowl or ur pretty sorry don’t make the rules
@Barnseygfc1 @SuperBowl @theweeknd Yes James you will have too and @theweeknd he was amazing 😻
&amp; now, a sad time is upon us. No more NFL until September. 😭 #NFL #SuperBowl
Gronk and AB with Superbowl TDs CTE really won today
Nada a ver com a historia. Mas só agora que eu vi que o Tom Brady havia saído do Patriots e ido pro Tampa (para ganhar mais um Super Bowl). O passe desse homem deve estar valendo algumas dezenas de milhões de dólares. Chocado. Certa é a Giselle.
@TomBrady really is the GOAT. Well done @Buccaneers smashed it #SuperBowl
Decent game that... Defo prefer the bucs Brady to the pats Brady but regardless you can't knock the man's achievements... 7... Unbelievable.!!!! #Brady #superbowl
It's embarrassing how disproportionately angry I get when they refer to the⁴⁴ #SuperBowl champions as the world champions. You can't invent a sport that only your country plays just so you can call yourself the world champions.
It’s nice to see a York Countian get a Super Bowl ring. Atta boy, Bruce!
In the end: enjoyable if you like watching a dominant defensive performance. I thought it was an disappointing game, but, you can’t win them all. #SuperBowl #NFL
Greatest of all time 🙏🏾, Buccaneers showing its done #SuperBowl https://t.co/R7JcypAk1M
It's the Superbowl!

@TomBrady is the absolute and ultimate goat of his sport! #SuperBowl #SuperBowlLV #SuperBowlWeeknd 🇺🇸🐐🏈🏆 #BBCNFL https://t.co/87hymB68lK
@TomBrady Just watched  The Superbowl what Match you guys were great well  done  see you in 7 months
This Says it All, They're @ Their  Happiest!
This is What They  Really Wanted, Not The Premiership, Not The Champions League!
It's "The Super Bowl" Folk's! We're Just There To Supply The Money For Their???? https://t.co/daj3JHJnxO
The bucs players are lucky enough to win the superbowl and go home to their own houses. 🤣
Fully deserved they never let the Chiefs get into it, Tom Brady is elite level, look forward to the hangover after my first two beers in over a month 🤣 #SuperBowl https://t.co/B3pCN8AOAt
Get in you Bucs 🏴‍☠️. Defence amazing both tonight and throughout the playoffs, Brady the 🐐. Super Bowl champions, get in!!! #superbowl #tampabay @ Chorley https://t.co/kHFOxUr5on
Royal Rumble last week. Super Bowl tonight.

Time to go to bed &amp; look forward to the day off work.
Best go sleep! Eaten triple my body weight. Roll on Super Bowl 2022!
Happy for Coach Arians but cannot help thinking what might have been had he stayed in AZ a little longer... #SuperBowl
Brady genuinely wow 🐐 43 running rings and still going strong. He’ll play more than just another year 👀 Well done @Buccaneers defensively a solid game and offensively just played with ease 👏🏼 #SuperBowl
What really surprised me was the Domination by @Buccaneers tonight ! Incredible #SuperBowl
Inspirational, uplifting and humble Tom Brady and his Team have made history after history. Congratulations @Buccaneers on winning #SuperBowl 

It was an all American game but across the pond we watched it into the early morning. Well done on keeping it covid-free zone too.
Super bowl champs  🏆🏈👏 Brady the greatest of all time @buccaneers @nfl @nfluk #superbowl #GOAT #bucs @ Wales https://t.co/h2K1nscEg6
#SuperBowl done now time for the test match.
I actually watched a bit of the Super Bowl on and off it ain't for me unfortunately but some achievement by Tom Brady 🏈
Tom Brady and Tampa Bay ....and it’s 3.31 am @SuperBowl https://t.co/k6LPYt6MWB
I will never understand why the owner of nfl teams is presented the trophy 1st after the super bowl and not the players, who actually won the bloody thing!?!!
Tom Brady - 18x Super Bowl Champion, returns for another rodeo at age 72
Is the Superbowl like the equivalent to the World Cup final but for America?
Kids are learning f*ck all tomorrow. Sorry, but #homeschooling is in #lockdown for 24 hours. #SuperBowl #BBCNFL #GreatGame #BradyTheGoat https://t.co/UN3Buij6pF
A 5 time Super Bowl MVP! It’s just staggering 🙌🏻 #SuperBowl
@joshgardner Amazing that replacing the QB equivalent of a magic 8 ball with the GOAT helps a team that was good at lots of things last year to be a Super Bowl winning team.
Tom Brady man. GOAT. #SuperBowl
Question now. Do I go to bed or have breakfast? #SuperBowl https://t.co/8qtZaCAdOo
Best team won on the night. Now they’ve won another Superbowl, hopefully now the Glazers can focus on fixing the circus behind the scenes at United
I love the #SuperBowl, but I'm always underwhelmed by the lifting of the trophy. 

The players should be the ones to lift it, not the owners. https://t.co/Vd2sVthsrN
The best trophy presentation in all of sports. Nothing else comes close. #NHL #StanleyCup #NFL #SuperBowl https://t.co/6ZCZkO801a
Un placer vivir la #SuperBowl con @javiblascodf
Fair play to Tom Brady... &amp; @Buccaneers unbelievable achievement #SuperBowl
Still pisses me off that the owners get presented with the trophy before the players. Still haven't figured out why in 24 years of watching the #SuperBowl
Giving Brady MVP was pure sentimentality. He had a solid game but not exceptional #SuperBowl
Enough about the Super Bowl.  That was last season.

2021 season starts now.
#SuperBowl MVP no 5 with win no 7
A moment we’ll always remember. 

#GoBucs   #NFLTwitter    #SuperBowl    #SBLV https://t.co/cOICH6FKpO
A hug &amp; "Keep in touch". Fantastic sportsmanship from @TomBrady to @PatrickMahomes !!!!! #SuperBowl #SuperBowlLV @SuperBowl @NFL #NFL #football @Buccaneers @Chiefs #Brady #Mahomes https://t.co/oQqCxMV8vv
The trophy being presented to the owners is the absolute worst. #SuperBowlLV #SuperBowl
That's the Glazers happy The Bucs defence was disciplined #SuperBowl now sort out @ManUtd defence...

United fans now begging the Glazer's to spend money! #SuperBowl
Me: seeing the Glazer family that own Tampa Bay Buccaneers and wonder why they sound familiar.

Also me: remembering that they also own Manchester United

7x Super Bowl Champion. https://t.co/r9LWE7ZZt3
Wow, 31-9 @Buccaneers ! Tom Brady at it again 🏈 #SuperBowl #GoatBrady
Hopefully that is the only trophy a Glazer team wins this year! @ManCity til I die! #SuperBowl #mcfc
The owners lifting the trophy first really sucks the joy out of the super bowl. Actual football really shows NFL up here! #SuperBowl
An absolutely insane record 🤯

I don’t think this will be broken any time soon 🏈

Congratulations @TomBrady!!! - 7 Super Bowl wins, SEVEN 🐐

#SuperBowl #Brady #NFL https://t.co/MxMjdQ7puI
As an Englishman, seeing a trophy be handed to the owner of a team, will never not be odd to me!! #SuperBowl
Annual tweet: worst trophy presentation in sports by a country mile. Players should get to touch the trophy first. Not ownership. #NFL #SuperBowl
Don’t think there’s any argument now, Brady is definitely the GOAT no question #SuperBowl #TB12
One sided but gripping #SuperBowl Congrats #TampaBayBuccaneers #TomBrady is the undisputed #GOAT
👏🏼 👏🏼 

#SuperBowl https://t.co/yi2xSbHzK6
#TomBrady as an individual probably does deserve the #SBLV #MVP award but the @Buccaneers Defence won that game, hands down! #GoBucs

7 Super Bowl titles for Brady, more than any franchise, just incredible! @NFL
Heinicke the only QB who gave Brady a decent game #SuperBowl

The story should be that Tampa defence. Unbelievable. #SuperBowl
Sorry @AndyRobsonTips for not giving you this SuperBowl tip before hand. But considering the highest odds bet I’ve ever won was like 16/1 with just a couple of quid on. I wasn’t expecting this BOOM! https://t.co/GjGqVRrJ9N
Seven #SuperBowl wins really is impressive #Brady
Just waiting on another Jackson Mahomes TicTok 👀 #SuperBowl
Super Bowl CHAMPIONS!!!! #KCvsTB #Buccaneers #GoBucs #Gronk #GOAT #SuperBowl
Nailed on Brady wins MVP but should be anyone in that bucs defence. They’ve won them the game #SuperBowl
Not the best game ☹️ but it’s quite unbelievable what #Brady has achieved 🏈🏈🏈🏈 #SuperBowl
Well this season was pretty good wasn’t it #SuperBowl #gobucs
Tom Brady really is the goat. Man is 43 and just won his 7th super bowl. Absolutely mad. Gotta feel for mahomes though, playing with a broken toe and his team gave him nothing to work with.. #SuperBowl
When the Super Bowl adrenaline dissolves....... https://t.co/Bp4KZ8EJiv
@NFLUK Probably. Just edges out Pete Sampras. Am #SuperBowl #Brady https://t.co/AfpVw2uV75
Thank you @Buccaneers ! Not just for winning the SuperBowl and capping of an incredible few months for Tampa Sports... but for giving me this beauty of my biggest odds/return win!

Bucs WIN. Bucs WIN. Bucs WIN!!!!! @Buccaneers @TomBrady @RobGronkowski @BruceArians #GoBucs #SuperBowl
Must admit when Tom Brady moved to Tampa I thought he would give them a fighting chance of a great season. To win another SuperBowl is just different class. #Legend
American football is a simple game. 22 men chase a ball around a field for 60 minutes, and in the end Tom Brady wins
#GoBucs #SBLV #SuperBowl
10 years since I started watching the NFL &amp; 10 years since I chose the #GoBucs as the team I’d follow because it had to be a team who wore red.

18 years later &amp; we’ve done it again. The defensive stood up against the future 🐐. Underdogs this postseason but we don’t mind. SUPER BOWL CHAMPS. So so proud of my 2nd home  @Buccaneers #GoBucs #RaiseTheFlags
You are absolutely phenomenal @TomBrady 
What an athlete, what a player
Completely epitomises a winning culture 
Arguments has to begin that he is now better than Michael Jordan with winning titles

Tom Brady will get the headlines, and rightly so after his 7th #SuperBowl success, but that Tampa defence was unbelievable today 👏

Not a great #SuperBowl but well deserved win for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Brady 7 times, first team to play at home stadium in SB and also to win.

Congratulations to the #Buccaneers! What a brilliant performance all round. Nothing left to say about #Brady, he’s just the GOAT. Hats off to everyone involved in the game for getting this season completed with everything else going on this year. Roll on September! #SuperBowl
20+ years of watching wrestling PPVs was good training for me to get to the end of the Superbowl for the first time.

I usually go to bed at the half time show.
That play there sums the game up. This Bucs defence has been absolutely incredible! Breed, Rodgers and Mahomes all beaten in the playoffs to win a #SuperBowl
White has had the best defensive performance in a #SuperBowl since Von Miller
Devin White for MVP. #SuperBowl #NFL

ZERO TDs for KC.
Won 3 on the road and dominated a brilliant Chiefs team. Kudos to Arians and Brady #SuperBowl

The old master schooling the young apprentice here!! 🐐 #Brady #Mahomes #SuperBowl  @NFL @NFLUK  @Buccaneers 🏈
Interception! This Bucs defense have been absolutely incredible all night. #SuperBowl
INTERCEPTION AND THAT IS IT FOLKS!!!!! #GoBucs #NFLTwitter #SuperBowl #SBLV
Yes, #Brady (&amp; Gronk) broke mine &amp; other Pats fans’ hearts... But the GOAT status wasn’t in doubt before the game &amp; now he usurps The Trainer Salesman as US sports’ greatest ever. Different pantheon.

It’s going to be bittersweet, yet historic in about 10-15 mins... #SuperBowl
GOAT #SuperBowl #BBCNFL https://t.co/yARCwntyTs
Teams with the most Superbowl wins:
3 - Broncos, Redskins, Raiders
4 - Packers &amp; Giants
5 - Cowboys &amp; 49ers
6 - Patriots &amp; Steelers
7 - Team Brady

What a fantastic achievement to take the Bucs to the #SuperBowl
after such a distinguished career at New England. 🏈
Easy street for the Buccaneers, brilliant from start to finish, that defence was frightening and the offence was extremely efficient, smashed apart a broken Chiefs team and thoroughly deserve to win the #SuperBowl 

Can’t take it away from TB12- 7 superbowls is special
Hope it’s worth the lifetime ban😂 #SuperBowl https://t.co/mHSk6wESI1
@GlenChervin2 In fairness, in Dubai, I think they might have went to bed, then got up in the middle of the night. 

In Western Europe, we stay up. And stay up for regular season games too. Am #SuperBowl https://t.co/Fq0Id4ZGoR
The fact that Tom Brady is 2 years older than me and just won his 7th #SuperBowl, only affirms I can do literally anything I set my mind to. 🤙🏻🏈
For me, this is up there with Ali KO’ing an undefeated Foreman to win The Rumble in the Jungle after everyone said he was too old and past it. #SuperBowl
Congratulations @Buccaneers and @TomBrady the greatest to ever do it!! 🐐 #SuperBowl
I love my home , I Love my sport but there is one Area outside Cardiff and Wales  that I am very a proud to call my favourite place away form home , I love you Tampa Bay! Tittle town! Stanley cup and Super Bowl #GoBucs #GoBolts
The amount of people who get so hyped for the Super Bowl but don’t watch American football any other time of the year 🤔

@JennySLo Didn’t realise Brady was a supporter of Trump, I will look into it, Trump &amp; his children aren’t to popular in the UK but hopefully America can get back on track now &amp; move forward! Surprised the Super Bowl wasn’t closer but I am a Rams fan so hoping we win it next year in LA 😬
Anyone who went to the Super Bowl is a dickhead why the stadium that packed 😷
It’s 4.23am, I’m physically and emotionally shattered but we are Super Bowl LV champions!
#GoBucs #LFG
They only thing that’s ever entertained me about super bowl is who’s preforming at half time
Man will watch the Super Bowl final and think they know everything. You didn’t watch one league game so fuck of with ur Analysis of who the best is
Any virgins still up that can tell me who Tom Brady is? #SuperBowl
At what point do you switch from the beer you were drinking watching the Super Bowl, to the coffee to accompany the cricket? Asking for a friend. #bbccricket

Here's @AntoineWJr11 telling me about the moment he shared with his father on the field after the game. https://t.co/BSn0h6UNhg
Well I was hoping for a Kansas City super bowl win but Tampa and Brady deserved it overall. That’s Brady’s 7th super bowl win / ring crazy. I think the Patrick Mahomes hype is over, he did nothing and his offensive lineup did nothing.Neither could handle the Tampa defensive press
The Glazers lording it up after the Superbowl, fkn Christ they are fkn shit staines. Fk em.
Up for work been a huge night on Twitter first thing I checked when logged on the Super Bowl....was it fuck it was the super steakpiegate btw anyone wanting a laugh check out the guys Twitter 🤣🤣 it’s like world war 4
@benthomases @Lenniesaurus Well we did used to have our own NFL Europe team back in the day. It was called the Scottish Claymores we played in 2 worldbowls, winning one and hosted another one. It was a great time wish it was still happening. But yeah the superbowl will have had lots watching from Scotland.
But my all time favourite will always be Beyoncé and let’s not forget Kelly and Michelle . That Pepsi half time show lives rent free in my head .....:iconic !!!! #SuperBowl #PepsiHalftime
Tom "Mr. Super Bowl" Brady 😎 fajnie, że kolejny raz tym razem dwóch graczy z polskimi korzeniami podniosło trofeum.
Just saying @MileyCyrus to be the Pepsi half time performer for Super Bowl 56  !!!! Please make this happen 🤞 #SuperBowlLV

@moving_matters1 @BucsUK @theukdukes @Jeff_Reinebold @NFLUK @Buccaneers @TomBrady Brady cements his statues as the goat. Chiefs struggled with penalties in the first half and in hindsight were to hands on in coverage.
Tampas defence was outstanding all night long and is probably the best defensive performance in any super bowl.

His voice does things to me yeno. 

Anyway, have a boss day! 

❤️❤️
Feeling somewhat vindicated that the #Packers were beaten by the eventual #SuperBowl winners. Wish this Brady fella would retire and let his true heir Rodgers share in the limelight 😂
No Spider-Man 3 trailer at the Super Bowl #sigh https://t.co/hWb1HYoHJw
So... the Americans shine again! Massive crowds allowed to watch the #SuperBowl in the stadium. Yet over here in the #uk we can’t do shit!! 

At least it’ll thin the herd the morons a little more...
How do you turn a losing team into Super Bowl champions over night?

Sign Tom Brady and get Gronkowski out of retirement for good measure.

Winning a home SB with limited fans must really suck!

Congrats to @ManUtd first English team to win a #SuperBowl isn’t that how it works given we finance them? Glazers drain our money and resources for #Bucs #GlazersOut

Staying up for the Superbowl is beyond my understanding.

OMG! Can we please talk about #TheWeeknd performance at this years #SuperBowl ??? 

Focussing on his vocal performance instead of flying around the stadium and those dancers?!? Hands down one of the best shows ☺️
I like American Football.

However, the way they call themselves 'World Champions' after winning the Superbowl is the most ridiculous thing in any sport.

Champions, yes. Well done. But why say you are world champions when its the only country that plays the sport.

Grow up.
All these tweets about the #Superbowl and no one is mentioning this guy? Rude.

That bit with siouxsie and the banshees happy house into you know what at the super bowl half time show was pure joy.
Now that Tampa Bay have won the Super Bowl, I wonder if the Glazers will put at least £1 into United. Will they fuck! They will still take money out of the club.
Well , with a #COVID19 affected season , and the advice to ‘Work from home’ if you can , any surprise that @Buccaneers won a Tampa #SuperBowl #Bucs

@lpowell092020 They were never going to show any, can't advertise them with no release date and they know it. Superbowl spots are incredibly expensive.
@Toffeebintlisa Woke up, didn't turn on any news sources, including Twitter, and just headed to the iplayer and watched the super bowl at my leisure. Lockdown at its best 👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾 Just want to learn more about the game now.
I’m knackered with a full day of work ahead on 3 hours sleep but totally worth it after an epic super bowl 55. Well done Bucs, incredible performance by everyone to stifle the chiefs and show who the real 🐐 is for now and always. https://t.co/d1PDcDcaKS
3hrs sleep. But so worth it to witness the Brady show. #SuperBowl
@TomBrady = absolute beast.

Well done @Buccaneers for winning the #SuperBowl !
@TomBrady what a legend. 
7th Super Bowl ring. 
Wow. What an achievement. 
At the age of 43!!!
Definitely #GOAT

Who’s idea was it to stay up and watch the super bowl? My eyes are BURNING
The 🐐 is very loosely used in sport these days, but not in Tom Brady’s case. The real master at his sport even before this Super Bowl. Watching somebody so good at his craft doesn’t come around very often. Worth the 3 hours kip. 
What a night #SuperBowl #TomBrady
As a guide to #TomBrady’s longevity, when he won his fourth of seven #SuperBowl titles, the current GTA was GTA V!!
Am I the only one who is shocked they let that many people together for super bowl? Like... covid... I can’t even...
Apparently it was the Super Bowl.
No idea who won, more to the point, don’t care who won.
What an incredibly dull sport it is.
🐐 🏈

Well it was fun to watch #SuperBowl to the half time show w/ @Bxzn0_. The Buccaneers were on top form!
Finally getting round to watching the important part of #SuperBowl , the halftime show and whoever mixed that had done @theweeknd dirty

It's unlistenable.
Fell down a rabbit hole@of watching SuperbOwl half time shows. Prince 2007 sent shivers down my spine.
@Buccaneers Congratulations on winning 🏈 Super Bowl LV 🏈 I enjoyed every minute of the game. From Wales in the UK xxx
To buy and stream Valheim today or stream ETS. I have only had about 2 hours sleep due to the super bowl tho
Even if you’re not interested in #NFL or #SuperBowl it’s quite interesting to read about the covid measures they took for the match. This just a taster. https://t.co/FXpN3DqXeh

I tried to watch the Super Bowl, but how can you possibly enjoy a sport that pauses every 5 seconds?

@Buccaneers defence won them the Super Bowl. @Chiefs were woeful. Tom Brady had an easy night.
Anyone see the Super Bowl last night? I was chopping some really important wood 🪵 so missed it, damn 😁
All the stories gon be about Tom Brady but no joke that Tampa D won them that Super Bowl. Bet Mahomes hadn't had to dance as much as he did last night
Bueno, por lo que leo, Rihanna y Chris Brown avisaron de que no actuarían en la Super Bowl por apoyo y respeto a Colin Kaepernick.
Los valores vienen antes que el dinero.
I’m looking at just how many records he holds, at the oldest guy ever to play a Super Bowl. I’m looking at someone who went looking for people told they were too old or let go by others for free and built a winning team. And! - he’s the good looking quarterback. Tom Brady. #star
@Nick_Britten I think what impressed me most was the running back quarter-linesman when he shifted to the offensive defence on the backfoot at the 47 yard forward line. Masterful play.

#SuperBowl
I watched most of #SuperBowl, probably fell asleep a few times as I was quite tired bt the 80% of the game I did see, I won’t be the only one to say this but #TomBrady really is the shit! Had the #Chiefs been a little more alert, could have been closer but, Bucs deserved it!

What a performance by Tampa Bay, defensively superb. What a story Gronk &amp; Brady #SuperBowl
Unless you have a significant wager on it, staying up till daft o’clock on a Monday morning for the #SuperBowl  is madness
Listening to The Weeknd in Sixth Form when he was a small artist to him doing the Super Bowl halftime show is wild to me, what a guy

Just astonishing. At 43 when everyone said he only won the 6 because he had the best System or Best Head Coach. To guide a team with the lowest win percentage of any Major Sports teams in the USA to win a Super Bowl is insane. All his pieces clicked. The best to ever do it. 🐐 https://t.co/4lJuH9KsT6
how did they even allow superbowl to happen? Like it’s THE pandemic, I can’t wrap my mind around it. idc about the free masks or precautions, you still had 26k ppl in ONE place?????

@cerarno @NFLUK The way it's structured, it's pretty much impossible to have a @LCFC story in @NFL the teams that compete for #SuperBowl change pretty frequently usually. They had a squad capable of winning with a good QB, enter @TomBrady who then brought some extra weapons
Ooooh, it was the Superbowl yesterday. I wondered why there were so many fursuiters suddenly wearing foodball gear on my timeline

@thismorning On the fat subject, we have just had the Super Bowl where, Fat/ Fit men run about for large wages. So it is possible to be fat and fit. It is also possible to be thin &amp; unfit.
Last nights game is up there with Rams v Pats in terms of biggest anti-climax. Brady did what Brady does, but that win was all about Tampa’s defence - White, Barrett or David should have won MVP. They helped shutdown one fo the most explosive offences of all time #SuperBowl

Cue social distancing at this years Super Bowl 😲🤦🏽‍♂️😂 https://t.co/jw9Jo6ihHj
@richardwakile At the end of the Super Bowl - did you look at the score?  The Team with the most points won. Get it now???
Has the Super Bowl finished yet? 😴
But it’s completely fine for 22,500 people to be welcomed into a stadium to watch The Super Bowl last night? https://t.co/dSLnOErP94
instead of watching tiktok all day, im just going to watch the weeknd’s super bowl performance
Who won the best ad during the Super Bowl?
Good game last night. Bucs played amazingly. Mahomes was kept quiet all night. #ChiefsvsBuccaneers #SuperBowl
It’s mad to think that Tom Brady has now won more Super Bowls than any team in NFL history and has been in the second most Super Bowls (10) second only to New England (11) #SuperBowl
Michelob #SuperBowl ad is brilliant and so thought provoking. Loving the concepts of “joy is the whole game” and “it’s only worth it if you enjoy it”

@tylerinacoma You mean why are we having a pandemic during the SuperBowl??
I wonder if Kansas city chief fans are at home today thinking they won the super bowl last night!? We know how (some) Americans struggle with numbers and how the larger number is the significant one. Lol 🇺🇲🏈
@JohnBrewin_ It's the closest Siouxsie and the Banshees will get to playing Superbowl.
Watching the @SuperBowl made me see that things can be semi normal again and we can still perform in front of an audience. The set was stunning well done @theweeknd it really made my day seeing a live performance again
Tom Brady one of the greatest sportsman of all time. FACT!
#nfl #TomBrady #SuperBowl #greatest #SevenRings
@mariana057 Yes, that's an excellent super bowl. 🤣
@JasonBell33 Hi Jason, I've loved NFL since I was a young kid in the early 80's. I picked @Broncos as my team. One thing I don't understand. Why do the super bowl winners call themselves world champions when it's only US teams involved? Thanks. #NFL

Watching the Superbowl has me anxious for more sport on TV!!
@washingtonfcuk1 Did last nights Super Bowl show a very solid QB will win you a Super Bowl if you have invested in your D and OLines? If so are Washington already half way there and no longer living on a prayer?
So as a Broncos fan that result was probably as good as it gets.  Divisional rival KC gets embarrassed, and despite getting the MVP it wasn't the Brady show - Fournette (should be MVP IMO), great D and KC pens won TB the SB.

#SuperBowl
Congratulations to the Buccaneers, what a great game, Tom Brady is an inspiration at 43 #SuperBowl

@AshBurty When the regular season rolls around again in September, that’s the best time to start watching. Personally I think the game flows a lot quicker, and less adverts because it’s not as much of an occasion as the super bowl. Plus it starts at 6pm too 😁

Bravo to @theweeknd for giving the best male half-time show in recent years #SuperBowl
Has SuperBowl finished yet?
@glenwheeler Brady’s previous 9 Super Bowl appearances were all for the Patriots. This was his first with the Buccaneers. Victory last night means he’s now won more Super Bowls (7) than any other player, or any NFL team.

@NFLUK @OsiUmenyiora No doubt about it. His dedication not only to the game, but to his body. It is above and beyond 99.9% of what a normal Jo would do in the workplace and 99.8% beyond what fellow sports people are prepared to give. He is the epitomy of dedication. #TomBrady #SuperBowl

@WillGav what was your Super Bowl prediction again? Not many pundits took Buccs even knowing KC’s injuries. Tom Brady is the GOAT!
I managed to stay awake for the whole of the super bowl last night for the first time ever because I’m normally asleep at the half, tired today though
Man United won a Super Bowl before a premier league, let that sink in
Had to block superbowl, don't understand how so many British give a flying fuck about it. Its garbage.
@terdofhurtles @DonaldJTrumpJr What's it got to do with the Superbowl, isn't an ex-president's family member entitled to an opinion, land of the free and all that?
@alexanderoldham @BucsUK Yep, once my bet winnings come through It all going on Bucs Super Bowl merchandise 😀
Between Tom Brady's 3rd Superbowl appearance and his 10th, Calvin Johnson has been drafted, retired, and made the Hall of Fame.
Johnson was drafted 2007, retired 2016, and got inducted yesterday

How can you compare the Super Bowl to the World Cup? Completely different scale and level of sport altogether.
Decided last minute against putting money on Tampa Bay at 7/1. Just finished watching the bowl and oh my days do I regret not making that bet! #SuperBowl

The Weeknd’s FULL Pepsi Super Bowl LV Halftime Show https://t.co/BfG3DfGInV via @YouTube @theweeknd
Last night is why it was idiotic for anyone to suggest the @Chiefs are the next #Dynasty after their #SuperBowl win last year. They may well be in time but they only have one ring. No one was shouting that 19 years ago when @TomBrady and @Patriots won their first ring #NFL
Something that is cool...when we won the SB back in 2003, Jon Gruden was the youngest head coach to win a Super Bowl, last night BA became the oldest - great little link there #gobucs #SuperBowlLV
I'll be considerate and not post Super Bowl spoilers for any fellow UK NFL fans (though seriously, get off this app and watch the game). But I will say I thought The Weeknd did great. The format for these shows are usually terrible so well done to him for pulling it off.
Right @Chiefs fans. Let’s get it straight. The penalties were a tad draconian for a #SuperBowl but you’ve been heavily penalised all season. It’s a weakness that needs addressing. But you lost because the offensive line was completely over run like I’ve rarely seen.
@JasonBell33 @OsiUmenyiora Top coverage guys, great to see you back with @markchapman and of course where would Superbowl night be without the evergreen Mike Carlson. 👏👏👏
So Brady and Bucs won the Super Bowl, and #DaBears  beat the Bucs, sooooo does that mean we are better? 🧐🧐 

🤣🤣🤣
Imagine Tom Brady winning a 7th Super Bowl and people won’t shut up about Mahomes throwing an incomplete pass 😒
Oatly's Super Bowl Commercial Goes Viral | Plant Based News https://t.co/hZUBcLMCjq
What the Chiefs found out the hard way is that it doesn’t matter how many elite offensive weapons you have. It all means nothing if your QB can’t get enough time to use them. Truth is if they had a healthy/better O-Line that is probably a very different Super Bowl game.

@talkSPORTDrive Adrian Durham has just said @talkSPORT "mahomes was the better Quarter back in the Superbowl, his receivers just let him down" this is why I love talksport, the comedy value is amazing!!!
Please @OsiUmenyiora explain why you say World Champions when a team has won a Super Bowl? It’s only American teams in it and sorry USA is NOT the world!!! Does that make a team that wins the football league here in Britain World Champions? Please stick to Super Bowl winners 👍

@SuperBowl we urge you for next year half time show @JanetJackson  and @britneyspears headline! They deserve it! #empoweringwomen
@SteelerStandard Think to you are a little harsh on the Steelers but that display in the Super Bowl by Tampa’s defense deserves a lot of credit for their win.

@C0balto 2004 Super Bowl Halftime performance... he exposed her breast accidentally but the subsequent news reports after slammed Janet. She was also banned from the Grammys because of the incident. He never spoke out against it. He never stood up for her.

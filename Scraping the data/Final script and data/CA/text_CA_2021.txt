It's crazy to think that Tom Brady will be playing in his 4th Super Bowl since Peyton Manning retired. 

They were drafted two years apart. 

Unreal.

Really, if you think about it #SuperBowl should foot the bill for a commercial and advertisement about human trafficking, since it perpetuates the problem by having a massive event of men buying teens girls and women...
“Super Bowl spots are ridiculously expensive (a 30-second ad during the 2021 Super Bowl runs $5.6 million) because the audience reach is huge.”

Who has $5.6 million to run a 30 second clip on human trafficking?

Was there a commercial about human trafficking made?

“You can sell a human being over and over again. Your #SuperBowl experience could easily net $50,000 in profit.”
2019 - 150 people were arrested as part of an FBI operation into sex trafficking in the lead-up to Super Bowl LIII.

34 individuals accused of trying to engage in sex acts with minors, 26 alleged cases of trafficking, nine reported adult victims and a further nine alleged youth.
2018 - 94 arrests were made over the Super Bowl during a sex trafficking sting operation.

Officers also recovered 28 potential victims, ages 17-49. Fourteen of the victims were from Minnesota, the other half were from out of state.

In the week leading up to last year’s Super Bowl in Miami, authorities arrested 44 people and rescued 22 victims of human trafficking.

So that was the week leading up to the event... so how many during the event? And after the event?

@FINALLEVEL To keep people in the seats and to sell tickets, follow the money.. (before covid of course) Question: why is Florida hosting a “super spreader” allowing 25k people to attend the Super Bowl in the middle of a pandemic?  WTF ? Don’t say it’s because it’s outside.

Watch Responsibly.

Just a message to anyone in BC hosting a full on Super Bowl party....you’re a douchebag.
Super Bowl Sunday is nearly here!

If there is a #SuperBowl Prop bet where Tampa runs a play where Tom Brady receives a pass... (like the one he missed vs Eagles) I'm all over it!
@Claud_Tweets @TODAYshow So enjoying watching this performance again!  Although in MY opinion her Super Bowl rendition was better.  But that’s just me.  The lucky Marine.  Memory of a lifetime for him.
Great perspective &amp; reminder when looking at the end result or the journey. Be in at work, in sport, in life, finding joy in the journey and in day to day moments 😊 https://t.co/b2L96OfSi6
Tom Bradys broken many records. Even his own records. Won Superbowl 6x, goes to a new team takes them to the Superbowl. Now, every deuch bag is comparing Mahomes being the greatest if he beats a 43 yr old superstar..yeah I'll stick up for Brady #SuperBowl

The 11 Superbowl weekends, and 11 years since have been much better for me.
Superbowl is forever connected to being dumped by my first boyfriend. After 6 years together, living together for 3. He dumped me. I cried. We ordered Chinese food. We sat and awkwardly watched the Superbowl not sure what else to do.

According to an ASU study, “the research identified distinct victim movement and marketing trends that tend to correspond with the build up towards the Super Bowl”. #SuperBowl  @worldweyouth
According to the study, the volume of ads marketing commercial sex exceeded law enforcement capability to follow up, giving traffickers leeway. #SuperBowl  @worldweyouth

This morning some non soccer friends asked about today’s big game.   Happy to report I got it right :

“In honour of the Super Bowl, I will handicap today’s big ⚽️ match in 🏈 terms:

Take City AND take the over!”
The fact that we get trailers for super bowl commercials is absolutely insane to me.

Somebody quick correct Viola Davis that Superbowl is not the world's largest sports stage. Maybe she was not heard of Soccer World Cup.
I also know with 100% certainty I will be asleep before the game is over #SuperBowl
The crappy thing about watching the #SuperBowl in Canada is that we don't get any of the good commercials.  Unless you consider commercials for The Good Doctor and Capital Direct good.
@fordnation Good luck with that. Super bowl Sunday &amp; Family Day coming up. 2-3 weeks later watch the #s climb...again!

Brady notoriously slow starter in the Super Bowl. Has never got a first quarter touchdown. Crazy being in his 10th

Not an Empty seat at the Super Bowl game 🤔 I ask my fellow Canadians do you feel like we’re getting Played ?
Is it coincidence? My story today in The Toronto Star, about the power of poetry - and then Amanda Gorman's performance at the Super Bowl?

The spotlight is on the power of the pen. Time to take note.

So proud to see Amanda Gorman share her poetry at the Superbowl this evening!

SO proud that Spoken Word is making the waves that it is! 🎉
Once again watching the super bowl and hating the CRTC for allowing Bell to override American commercials.  I mute and watch the real commercial on YouTube. So annoying.
2 for 2 feeling like its gonna be a great night! #SuperBowl
I only have one thing to say before the #SuperBowl starts. Never bet against Tom Brady.
Go ads go!

I may be in the minority, and I understand the prestige and media attention of the #SuperBowl . But I’d rather hear the anthem played how it’s supposed to be played. I don’t need to hear it ‘all done up’...it’s still supposed to be a championship football game 🏈
@pamie9 It's #Wrestlemania  Ben quoi, c'était sensé être là l'an dernier et ce sera là cette année 😂#SuperBowl
#SuperBowl looks like a super spreader event. 🤦🏼‍♀️

@LeoRautins @SuperBowl Wondering if KC is playing this like a regular game. The officials seem to be on them big time with the holding calls and the off side calls as if they’ve done this before. KC should change their tactics.
Seriously I think Tom Brady and Rob Gronkowski will win the superbowl then dominate #WrestleMania then take over #UFC . Prove me wrong!!
Crazy that gronk retired went to wwe and has now scored two touch downs in the super bowl 😂

It’s -36 out and we forgot to buy snacks for the Super Bowl #Super Bowl
So they went all playoffs not calling any holding in the secondary and "letting them play" but now it's the Superbowl they're calling everything? Talk about mixed messages

Showing the same 4 commercials during the SuperBowl is Bell's way of distracting Canadians that they laid off hundreds of people and fave their shareholders bigger dividends

Thanks to @Ford for that commercial, it’s likely the only time a Bronco will appear in a Super Bowl broadcast in the next decade or so.

Well @ericchurch killed the anthem, but more importantly it was over 121.5 seconds ✅ #SuperBowl #Propbets
So to be clear... we’re not getting the fun commercials in Canada again? #SuperBowl

“Tom Brady has never thrown a TD in the first quarter of a Super Bowl in his career.” #SuperBowl https://t.co/0MrwDp5rdv
Watching the #SuperBowl on Canadian TV is just the same Skip the Dishes commercial playing over and over again.
Brady and Gronk is there a better duo in sports  #SuperBowl

It took 10 games but Brady finally got a TD in the first quarter.  #underachiever #SuperBowl

That’s the extent of #SuperBowl live tweeting I will engage in! 😆 https://t.co/bn469vgaN4
Did anyone else get vertigo from the half time show?

#SuperBowl
With penalty call like that of the first half we now have confirmed proof it was Brady buying off the refs the whole time.

@theweeknd THANK YOU! For being the light and giving everyone something to cheer and dance to in the homes! A #Canadian unifying again and being a #peacekeeper it's in our DNA! Best Superbowl halftime ever!!! We all needed that.  #SuperBowl #HalfTimeShow #Canada #Globalization
Outside of my preferred genre of country music, @theweeknd is one artist I would never get sick of and he just proved why. What a great #PepsiHalftime . Not bad for Scarborough boy. #TheWeeknd #SuperBowl

That #PepsiHalftime show...
He is an amazing talent, no question. 
But I knew 3/8 of the songs. For me, someone doing the Halftime show needs to have a solid (known) set list from start to end. #SuperBowl
Como jogam esses dois Grong e Brady! #SuperBowl ! 🇨🇦🇧🇷
Thoughts on our Canadian boy  @theweeknd? 🇨🇦 Were you feeling the typical halftime performance excitement?
#SuperBowl #HalfTimeShow 🏈🎤 https://t.co/7gnE7a4vHh
@brandongonez @theweeknd I'm sorry but it was boring. Nothing on last year's halftime show with @JLo and @shakira 🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️ #HalfTimeShow #SuperBowl

@CBCKatie Its been a great weekend for 🇨🇦 , eh?  With Dan Levy hosting SNL &amp; the Weeknd playing the Super Bowl half-time show tonight?

So. @tonyromo has a pee mark on national TV... #SuperBowl #SuperBowlLV https://t.co/mzgAXAwFKO
Sorry @theweeknd love you but that was underwhelming. Seemed like it would have been great in person but came across very average on tv. #HalfTimeShow #SuperBowl
Amazing performance of @theweeknd in the #SuperBowl #HalfTimeShow https://t.co/ztM3L8CJBY
Just noticed that if you capitalize a different letter #SuperBowl becomes #SuperbOwl🦉 

#ImGoingToBed
That was literally the best super bowl halftime performance. The Weeknd is a legend.
After an entire Covid season spent masked up, the coaches still can't stop holding their play cards over their faces to make sure someone doesn't lip read their calls. #SuperBowl
@LaFalang Chez mon frère pour le Superbowl..... Et pour ma fête 😉

Incredible, amazing and simply the best! What a performance by the @theweeknd!! It gave me goosebumps and it’s great to see a Canadian from Scarborough put on a show like that at one of the biggest sporting events on the planet 🙌🏽 #SuperBowl #SBLV #TheWeeknd
Holy Smokes @theweeknd just killed the #HalftimeShow! What an insanely good performance! 🤩#blindinglights #SuperBowl #canadianproud https://t.co/xq2jpMEowd
Still my top Super Bowl halftime show list:

1. Michael Jackson 
2. Prince 
3. Beyoncé 
4. Bruno Mars
I’m seeing people calling that the best Super Bowl Halftime show ever.

Proud that Canada 🇨🇦 represents at #SuperBowl   Show was not quite the usual hype but #TheWeeknd is amazing https://t.co/3TAMmqPDHv
Worst ever half-time show of the #SuperBowl #superbowl2021 #PepsiHalftime #TheWeeknd
Watered down Michael Jackson without the moves but he is #Canadian so I’ll give a 6 out of 10. #SuperBowl #theweeknd #Halftime https://t.co/UYBX8cYvlH
I saw the only part of the Super Bowl I usually care about. Good show by The Weeknd. I like how he made use of the entire field, since fans weren’t allowed on it to watch the show this year. I forgot to watch Amanda Gorman, so I’ll have to find that on YouTube.
That was basically my first live concert in almost a year. #TheWeeknd killed it.  😍#SuperBowl
EPIC halftime #SuperBowl performance from @theweeknd. Proud of our Canadian music scene and for the 1st Canadian to headline a solo halftime show! #SuperBowlWeeknd #SuperBowlLV #sundayfunday #Starboy
Oh no. Our Canadian son. We’re so proud of him &amp; this performance. Just hoping the media can find some kindness for @theweeknd (a killer talent who had guts to perform this Covid year) #SuperBowl https://t.co/EWOqT9raAD
#SuperBowl #PepsiHalftime 🎆📺🏈 https://t.co/qvmHiPfzLu
I am sure that a lot of money was spent to have @theweeknd sing at #SuperBowl #halftimeshow too bad none of it was put towards sound mixing so we could actually hear him.  @NFL #NFLPlayoffs #PepsiHalftime
The Weeknd’s Super Bowl performance made me proud to be watching a Canadian feed.
@brandongonez My exact thought through his whole performance 🥰 #thebest @theweeknd #SuperBowl https://t.co/EfddtRjthr
Well I would say that $7 million “cinematic experience” was well worth it. @theweeknd #PepsiHalftime #SuperBowl
Yo can someone send me a link to the Super Bowl
Holy cr*p that #SuperBowl #HalfTimeShow was 💣 

Bravo WEEKND 👏

Man.... I’m absolutely speechless at that #SuperBowl halftime show.  @theweeknd absolutely knocked it out of the park man, so damn proud of this city and of 🇨🇦
Honestly I can't see where that 7 million went. The sound level of the vocals was way off. I didn't hate it and it was very contemporary but given all the hype I was waiting for something special. #SuperBowl #PepsiHalftime
Solid job by The Weeknd. Usually I find these pretty tedious. That was impressive. 
#SuperBowl #TheWeeknd
Best Super Bowl Halftime Show ever still #SuperBowl https://t.co/njBo09NIXG

@brandongonez I thought it was boring....sorry. @theweeknd #SuperBowl #HalfTimeShow
Well that was pretty good. He tried hard to pump the energy up considering most of his songs aren’t really up tempo. The “show” he put on was solid. Score: 7.2 #SuperBowl
That #HalfTimeShow was next level!!! @theweeknd So good...gave me chills!! #SuperBowl
Mais quelle performance absolument incroyable de @theweeknd 💯 au #SuperBowl 

La scène, la mise en scène, la chorale, les danseurs, les violons, toute. Wow.
That was, hands down, the greatest &amp; most creative Super Bowl Halftime Show I’ve seen in years 🤩 Well done, @theweeknd | #SBLV #PepsiHalftime #theweeknd https://t.co/6cqoVpLlKp

Very proud to see #TheWeeknd put on an amazing #SuperBowl show. That’s our 🇨🇦!

What a weekend for Canadian talent with @danjlevy hosting @nbcsnl and @theweeknd playing Super Bowl Halftime
@brettgorday I agree, I thought Mahomes, did a great job. #SuperBowl

It’s funny that the Super Bowl half time show with The Weekend was sponsored by Pepsi considering his love for coke
The Weeknd KILLED IT!  #SuperBowlHalftimeShow #SuperBowl #SuperBowlLV #TheWeeknd @theweeknd #PepsiHalftime
https://t.co/iaIOLvuIOj. Super Bowl XLI was in Miami.

I had the incredible good fortune to be there.

Prince was the half time show.   I have yet to see another one come close!

The ultimate was him singing “Purple Rain” as it started to rain.
I’ve always loved @theweeknd and his @SuperBowl #HalfTimeShow is an example of his amazing artistry, vocals and musical repertoire. #PepsiHalftime https://t.co/BGjBlyHrh3
That was a wicked halftime show! The Weeknd slayed! #SuperBowl https://t.co/GbVNwofaCi
My Twitter feed tells me that those that are regular @nfl watchers aren’t digging the half time show. Those that watch the @SuperBowl just for the half time show are beyond happy.

Wow! #TheWeeknd killed it!!! Amazing performance! So proud of our 🇨🇦🇨🇦boy!!! #SuperBowl
I ❤️ The Weekend #SuperBowl #PepsiHalftime
Honestly if we knew the refs were going to be this bad and gifting Brady 14 points, they should of just made the line chiefs -17 and let the boys actually play football #SuperBowl
#TheWeeknd Just killed it. #SuperBowl 🇨🇦
That was a shame. Hopefully the second half is better #SuperBowl
@theweeknd AMAZING HALF TIME WOWZA #SuperBowl #HalfTimeShow
@callmemrmorris No way Covid was stopping the Super Bowl and a crazy halftime show. Smh, props to the Weeknd, though, he’s bringing’ it! You think the red/black suit and mask might pass for PPE when we go back? ❤️the look.
@theweeknd was so good!!! #SuperBowl
Did the sound engineer fall asleep? I would’ve been ok with a replay of last year’s halftime show #SuperBowl #JLo #Shakira

Chiefs are done, but so impressed with Mahomes...incredible athlete #SuperBowl
Anyone taunting during a Superbowl game should have to sell their SB ring and donate the proceeds to charity. What poor sportsmanship 👎 @Buccaneers #SuperBowl
Keep denying @TomBrady as a GOAT but after today you can’t say nothing; he won this one after having joined a whole new team/franchise! #Brady 

Deny all you want but this man dedicated every breath to his craft! Congrats 🙌🏽

It doesn’t matter what anyone says or does. Somehow, some way, @TomBrady comes out the winner. 🐐 🐐 🐐 🐐 🐐 🐐 🐐 #SuperBowl

Spoke with someone in anti-trafficking advocacy and a survivor..

Asked about the super bowl/SRA.

They said that this is harmful to the movement and damaging to survivors and victims.
Life lesson learned. Never go to the #SuperBowl without a starting Offensive Tackle, also don’t do it against Brady and the @NFL referees. https://t.co/VsuLOwcOIp
in MY opinion, I THOUGHT this game would of been closer.

Idk... but if you’ve heard of a little something called the Opening or Closing Ceremonies of the Olympics than you also know the Super Bowl is NOT the world’s largest stage. #SuperBowlHalftimeShow
@ScottyMacThinks Usually, Brady is involved in exciting finishes, win or lose, over his previous nine Superbowl appearances. Until tonight, only exception would have been the Pats over the Rams two years ago.
I feel like the Browns would’ve made this more interesting @Browns #SuperBowl

@BruceArians Guess it’s not too early to say congrats Coach.  Can’t wait to see that diamond laden fancy gold custom TB @SuperBowl ring to wave to those naysayers from the past. 👍🥇🏈

@KaranEsch Damn good 🇨🇦 right there . Even though we haven’t watched a second of any of the super bowl 😂. Wat hung pbs about China and Corona virus 🤔
@hunterhockey @ClaudeFeig I only know of one other college lacrosse player to win a Super Bowl ring.  Pretty special.
Are the officials allowed to win Super Bowl MVP??
Dude has more Superbowl titles than the Steelers.
This tweet is for every Steelers fan cheering for TB12.
This is gross
Might as well hit a super bowl since this one sucked
Oh, no. That fan just broke through the KC o-line and sacked Patrick Mahomes for a loss. #SuperBowl https://t.co/zXa9pZb2ZD
Why do people even watch sports? This ain’t fun. Between the #Canucks and this #SuperBowl it’s nothing but pain.
The streaker was the best part of the #SuperBowl
@Vitalyzdtv was that you running on the field 😂😂😂#SuperBowl
Bucs’ big men so impressive on both sides of the ball...controlling the game on the line of scrimmage...#SuperBowl
A simply terrible Super Bowl and I ate all these extra calories for nothing! https://t.co/GdNT4fjxzj
Hurry up and get that fan off the field, my Nana has been waiting for the game to finish so she can go to bed. 😒🤣 #SuperBowl
Yaaaaassss a streaker!!! 😂😂😂 That takes some BIG kahones!! #SuperBowl
Anyone bet that they’ll be a field ‘streaker’? #SuperBowl
Running onto the field... Really #SuperBowl
The #streaker would be the highlight of the game for #ChiefsKingdom 😂 #SuperBowl
Haven’t seen an old fashioned fan run on the field in a hot minute! #SuperBowl
Come on @CBS Show the fan running on the field, we want to see the security tackling him down. Even Brady was looking at him #SuperBowl
Security only had to deal with cardboard cutouts &amp; a streaker was still able to get onto the field?!?

This game just solidifies for me that Damien Williams shoulda been the Super Bowl MVP last year. #SuperBowlLV
We all know who the MVP gonna be. The refs #SuperBowl
Am I the only one not watching or excited about the Super Bowl?? 😂
Manchester United are winning this #SuperBowl https://t.co/Zs8fgcNasc
@ShawInfo if my tv goes dark again during the Super Bowl I’m switching to Telus.
@taylorswift13  Also if Tom Brady and the Buccaneers hold on to win will you go on a date with me? #SuperBowl
Apparently 30,000 #SuperBowl seats were sold for $100 each for people to have cardboard cutouts of themselves attending! 😅 #Boardgame players? 😂Really fascinating seeing our desire to be part of something bigger than ourselves: https://t.co/Zzue8H1OaV
People say defense wins championships. I’ll argue that o lines win titles. Look at KC without one. #oline #cfl #nfl #SuperBowl

Todd Bowles’ D has held Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs to 9 points in the #SuperBowl

The New York Jets fired Bowles in order to hand the keys over to this guy. https://t.co/CjYHliLb0k
So sick of the @bellmedia commercials #SuperBowl
Si #mahomes  veut le MVP, il lui reste 8 minutes #SuperBowl
I find it humorous that all the car/truck commercials during #SuperBowl are for hybrid or electric vehicles 😂😂.  Another platform for pushing the left’s agenda
I don’t think I will ever understand the appeal of the #SuperBowl .

Although to be fair my favourite show stopping event of the week was Joe Biden’s Inauguration and the subsequent cabinet hearings! 🤷🏼‍♀️
Who does Tom Brady decide to win a Super Bowl with next?
@budweiserusa #EyesOnTheClydes #sweepstakes #SuperBowl
Drew Lock has never looked this bad in a Super Bowl #BroncosCountry
y’all are fuckin quick with the weekend/super bowl memes 😂 holy fuck
People can say this #SuperBowl is boring but the #Bucs are playing balanced disciplined football. Total team effort.
How many times does @TomBrady have to win the #SuperBowl for it to be named after him. #TheTomBradyTrophy
100% Agree!!
#SuperBowl https://t.co/GOKsKOPj61

We need to accept dualities. He can be an exceptional football player AND an exceptional POS #SuperBowl
@bmomba_ @TaraSlone @JerryBeal9 @Sid_Seixeiro Yes, but that happened 18 years ago when Shania Twain performed at Super Bowl XXXVII.
Sur @RDSca en début d’après-midi Pierre Vercheval disait que le Super Bowl allait se jouer dans les tranchées. Jusqu’à maintenant la ligne défensive des Buccs domine la ligne offensive des Chiefs. Ça fait mal. #SuperBowl
I’m not watching the SuperBowl and I don’t know or care who is playing but I do hope your team wins!

@cameronwathey25 @TomBrady I think you’re right. @TomBrady is going to be the #SuperBowl MVP.
Ok if no one is gonna say it then I am 👍...... The @BuffaloBills would have given @Buccaneers a better game then this version of the @Chiefs team 😡

Someone please check on @getnickwright. #SuperBowl
He won’t win, but those were two incredible throws by Mahomes. #SuperBowl
This is not on Mahomes. He has receivers and running backs who can’t catch. #SuperBowl
Chiefs O-Line can't handle that Bucs pass rush at all. #SuperBowl #SBLV #ChiefsKingdom #GoBucs
Mahomes is running for his life out there, losing both their starting tackles is killing them #SuperBowl

My biggest takeaway from this game is that the Kansas City coach really needs to learn how to wear his mask #SuperBowl
They missed a holding call there.    But yeah. #SuperBowl

The Health Care professionals and first repsonders deserve to be at the Super Bowl, not the people who shorted GameSpot and got out early
Unless the 4th Q features an insane Mahomes comeback, the most memorable thing about this Super Bowl will be the half-time show https://t.co/XwxZkRabuN

Super Bowl was different without the gathering we’re used to - food was definitely on point and thankfully, we don’t eat like that too often!
Just rewatched #TheWeeknd halftime show. Unreal!! #SuperBowl
Let me qualify that. Super Bowl halftime shows have been spectacular in the past. This just didn't meet the bar unfortunately.

What if Tom Brady (TB) moved to Tampa Bay (TB) just so that those initials lined up and when shown on television during #Superbowl, people thought KC means Kansas Chiefs and TM means Tom Brady? 😂😂
There were 2 competing Oat Milk companies that had Super Bowl commercials in case you’re wondering what you missed on the US feed.
This dude called me up before the game to tell me the #GoBucs were going to win big after he saw this graphic. Can’t bet against a dude that can rock it like that on the way to the stadium. #SuperBowl @TomBrady https://t.co/Nl3hYvO1tn

One final tweet for tonight: Most underrated part about #SuperBowl is that The Weeknd made the Halftime Show fully COVID safe. Such an amazing performance as it was too. You can tell he’s Canadian just for having that fact in there tbh...

Tampa Bay Celebrating 2 Championships First the @TBLightning for winning the Stanley Cup a few months ago and now the @Buccaneers for winning the #SuperBowl 🏆
Tampa Bay, what a year in sports. Stanley Cup champs, World Series loss, Superbowl win. Not too shabby.  Most cities don't have that C/V in 20 years.
Players work so hard for Trophy... Yet owners are the first to  put their hands on it... NFL needs to change this! #SuperBowl
Well #ChiefsKingdom won last year. Can’t be THAT mad...but to Tom Brady and Gronk?! F that noise. Keep that trophy warm til next year. #SuperBowl

You can’t honestly tell me that Brady was the sole reason for each of his 7 super bowl rings. Last time I checked, if a chain had a weak link, it wouldn’t tug anything
Even the sorcerer who drew up Tom Brady’s blood pact thinks 7 Super Bowls and 5 SB MVP awards is a bit much. #SuperBowl

The #SuperBowl presentation begins with Jim Nantz asking literal billionaires how they managed during these “trying times.”
@TomBrady’s winning percentage in the super bowl is higher than my grade 9 average..😒 #SuperBowl #nfl
Glazers Family hope say this Super Bowl don belle full yuna. Time to pump money into @ManUtd for next season.
Every year, incredibly stupid to hold off on giving the trophy to the people that actually won it! #SuperBowl
Dumb to hand the trophy to the owner of the team. Might as well give it to the team bus driver! #SuperBowl
Normalize letting the players touch that trophy first #SuperBowl
From one goat to another! Tom Brady Superbowl and Lebron James winning a back to back! 2021 off to a great start
I’m a Tom Brady fan and I’m so overjoyed that the Bucs won the Super Bowl!
Is it just me or does that look like Superbowl 54??? https://t.co/TpYjCpOJ9I
What a lopsided win... congrats to Brady and the Buccaneers! #SuperBowl #SuperBowlLV
Finally the team I am cheering for in the #SuperBowl wins!!!!
Congrats @Buccaneers. Looking forward to next season!!
For next year's #SuperBowl I think we need a @RuPaul halftime show. https://t.co/31tBL5pgHf
the audience at the superbowl.......... seriously?
Goodell having to give @TomBrady another super bowl after that fake ass deflategate
The #SuperBowl was a snoozefest but #TomBrady cemented himself as the #GOAT 🐐 #athlete of all #sports GOAT's with this Championship victory 👐 #GoBucs https://t.co/wkgETgpjPD
Dammit, we didn’t even had time to digest the #SuperBowl 😭 

RIP @pedrogomezESPN 🥺 #BaseballFamily
Does being alive to watch TB12 and Tiger, offset having to live through a global pandemic? Wrong answers only. Go. #SuperBowl
Bucs Super Bowl Champs 
Lightning Stanley Cup Champs 
Rays make it to World Series 
Raps need to get their ass in gear lol
#SuperBowl Chiefs were shocking. They didn’t get going from beginning to the end. TB was dominant in defense, offense etc
That half a second i did in the Heinz commercial ended up airing during the Super Bowl While Tom Brady makes history ! Alhamdulilah, like I said always be grateful 🙏🏽
Never been so wrong about the Super Bowl prediction since Super Bowl XLII between Broncos and Seahawks...That Bucs defense today came to work. Chiefs missing their tackles didn’t help either #SuperBowl
Congrats Tampa Bay #SuperBowl
The White Jersey. That's the tweet. #SuperBowl
Super Bowl winner and aging: The head coach is 68 (oldest ever). The quarterback is 43. The tight end comes out of retirement at 31. And the winning team is from Florida. #SuperBowlWeeknd
Was off on the over/under. But totally right about the 🐐. Never bet against the 🐐! Amazing defensive performance by the Buccs. Big storyline is Patrick Mahomes never found the end zone. #TB12 is the undisputed GOAT. #SuperBowl
I feel compelled to open a Questrade account after watching the  #SuperBowl  #MarketingBowl
The Super Bowl Curse remains. No B2B champions in almost half a century.
While enjoying my #SuperBowl I want to shoutout the #RealSuperHero Doctor @LaurentDTardif for choosing Team Canada and saving lives from #COVID19. Thank you Doctor, you are a true inspiration, so proud of you. https://t.co/Wi5JfAtoWu

Patrick Mahomes did not throw a TD tonight 🤯 #SuperBowl
My Steelers Win 11 straight.
Steelers lose to division rival in worst loss in franchise history.
Brady leaves AFC, wins Superbowl with new team.

This defines the 2020 football season.

I hate it here.
Thank you @Buccaneers #Goodnight #SuperBowl #SBLV #LetsGo #Buccaneers @TomBrady 🐐🏈 #Champions #NFL

We know now Tom Brady won another #SuperBowl. What inspired me more was the show on @CTVToronto right after where #HolmesFamilyEffect reinvigorated @PeelSchools @JudithNymanSS’s Constuction Shop so its students can realize their #skilledtrades dreams! @therealrussellp cameo too!
@Chiefs All I have to say is your luck of the season didn't just simply run out that night. You practically threw it all away.

Not a single touchdown? What's up with that?

2. Bucs preparation was amazing great job by whole coaching staff
3. Bucs won line of scrimmage  both side
4. Mahomes had no time
5. Great mix of pass and rush fornette was a beast
6. Brady goat something special 
7. Gronk back

Super Bowl Sunday reminds me of 1 year going to work the next day &amp; telling the straight guys how I went on a date, with another guy, to see a Broadway musical instead of watching the game.
@MerrellTwins @Chiefs @MerrellTwins sorry for saying this to you but literally I watched Kansas City they lost by 9 hopefully, they will win against super bowl another there team players. Here is the twist unfortunately BK won by 31 that’s ok! No big deal. https://t.co/MuNwwKgjjL
Good Morning to everyone except the Kansas City Chiefs. #GoBucs TAMPA BAY BUCCANEERS ARE THE SUPER BOWL CHAMPIONS!!! #SuperBowl
couldn’t they have just simply skipped the super bowl and not held a super spreader event? idk just thoughts

The Jeep Super bowl ad is great....but that’s because I’ve seen it before. It’s a complete knockoff of Ram’s “God made a farmer” ad from 2013. While Consumers might not know, the industry knows.

I decided to go all the way back to #AEWDynamite episode 1 when I got home from #SuperBowl shenanigans. 

Whoever was in that meeting 🤩
(🤔@TonyKhan @CodyRhodes @youngbucks @KennyOmegamanX 👀-)... you all agreed that @sammyguevara vs @CodyRhodes was THE match to open with
31-9 no ints, 3 TDs and his 7th super bowl ring on his 10th time going to the chip.Idc what a QB did during the season or whatever got Aaron that mvp. BRADY NEEDS EVERY BLOOD CLAUT TROPHY, I'm not even a fan but you gotta honor and respect  game my lord my lord.
The Floridians mask less display, during their Super Bowl celebrations in Tampa, ruins, all they accomplished, by winning it! A lot of people will get sick, and will die, once it is spread around! Example set, by Donald Trump and @RonDeSantisFL . @TomBrady could have been better!
I’m still in a betting mood after the Super Bowl... what’s the Over/Under @elpwrestling gets involved in something tonight? Where can I place my bets? Njpw gambling ring anyone? #njnbg

Tom Brady just won his seventh Super Bowl at age 43, he isn’t considering retirement in the slightest, and absolutely none of us are surprised by any of that.

Take that in.
@ThePubliusUSA @dad_darius Yep.  And dude won his 7th freaking Super Bowl. 7!!  He is the GOAT. He’s an ass but he is amazingly talented.

The Richard Brothers, Maurice (Rocket) and Henri (Pocket Rocket) congratulate Tom Brady on his 7th Super Bowl. Tom needs one more Super Bowl to catch Maurice for Stanley Cup wins (8), and three more to catch Henri (11). #SuperBowlLV #LordStanley #Live4Puck

Ottawa public health is really leaning in on their super bowl error, right up to denying that Bruce even exists. I met him once: heck of a guy and deserves a second chance. https://t.co/Vp9CAaMcdt
@ComplexMusic @theweeknd @chartdata You made Canada proud at yesterday's superbowl.   You were clearly the highlight of the event.  My entire  family can't wait to see you live.
@eric_rahill the scariest demons live in side us. This must have been tough to share, I could see you tearing up a little. If it’s any constellation, we can celebrate Tom Brady winning the super bowl.
If Tom Brady is a #goatofgoats, with 7 SuperBowl Champs, he needs to have 5 more championships to beat the hockey legend's record, Henri Richard, with 11 Stanley Cup Champs.

As I was watching the Super Bowl I couldn’t help but thinking about my nephew Patrick Lee. Patrick got his Super Bowl ring in 2010 With his team the Green Bay Packers! So proud of you, Patrick, for putting in hard work and dedication; it paid off! https://t.co/pgwYyWb0tY
If Tom Brady is a #GOAT of all GOATS, with 7 SuperBowl Champs, he needs to have 5 more championships to beat the hockey legend's record, Henri Richard, with 11 Stanley Cup Champs.

Yeah, but I still think @prince, @BrunoMars and @U2's Super Bowl performances are worthy as @katyperry's. https://t.co/Ht13I8ChbZ

@RealJeffCesario Great job as Chet Waterhouse during the Super Bowl on the Stereo app. Chet might need to expand to the full season next year. Thanks.
Very shocking to hear this kind of news even during the hysteria of #SuperBowl.  If my memory served me right in addition to being a baseball reporter, he did call a @Padres game for @espn (don't remember their opponent). https://t.co/gGEQOCDTa9

Did they have the right Roman numerals displayed at yesterday’s super bowl? I thought I seen 54? But than again I only have one eye.
When will men just learn to celebrate woman?  

Why is this still happening in 2021? 💔😡

@ScooterMagruder On a side note.  The streaker from the Super Bowl.  He laid down $50k &amp; won $375k.  +750 prop bet.  There will be a streaker at the Super Bowl.   Cost him $1k to get out of the jail.
Absolutely brilliant.
Now that the #SuperBowl is over, I’m dreaming of summer nights at #SkyDome watching the #BlueJays. Hope that happens this year!! #LetsGoBlueJays #MLB https://t.co/JPn8jI8VVz
The biggest sporting event of the year. The Super Bowl. Whether you're a fan of football or not, this time of year is, if just for a moment, when most of the world comes together.

@JJ_Calabrese Love Josh Allen... but the difference is a regular season MVP a Superbowl and Superbowl MVP when u do as much as Mahomes has in his young career u get a different type of treatment..I don't know why but it seems obviously.
I thought it was weird to have those cardboard cutouts in the seats at the Super Bowl, but dressing them for the Leafs in this game is even more questionable.
Leafs playing like they still hungover from Super Bowl party

How many more years does @TomBrady have left? More than two perhaps? Seems to be in a perfect spot for him at the moment with the @Buccaneers....barely touched in the Super Bowl

Put my first fleet up yesterday. It was a retweet of Miley singing the climb from the Super Bowl pre show. I apparently have sensitivity settings and I can’t see my own fleet. Ffs. Whaaat? And why is that considered sensitive? #FleetsFeedback
@ACTBrigitte BREAKING NEWS. The Kansas City Chiefs have been declared winners of the 2021 Super Bowl. Points have been discovered and tabulated in the hours after the game’s official end. All points MUST be counted!  Any disagreement will be deemed as conspiracy theory and or racism.

@adage @1236 Sort of surprised some VPN company doesn't run an during the first few minutes of the SuperBowl. "Don't like the Canadian ads? Sign up and you could be watching the good stuff in minutes! "
@crslowey91 @jeffphowe @TomBrady The NFL Championship versus Super Bowl distinction is for idiots. The college football championship format has changed over the years but there’s no asterisk next to AP or BCS college titles. Fewer teams/players arguably means talent was less diluted. A title is a title, period.
Happy birthday @michaelb4jordan! 
🥳🥳🥳🥳 Apparently we’re birthday twins, born on the exact same day AND year! Enjoy the day - loved your super bowl commercial. 😉
@virtualcasey it’s so upsetting... we’ve all had our lives paused, only socializing with a handful of ppl (or less) and having all concerts cancelled (in my case that hurt a lot 😭) but then for the superbowl it’s okay like?!!?!
So apparently the streaker at the Super Bowl made 370k+ betting that there would be a streaker at the Super Bowl........ 🤝

The headline was eventually changed, but the opening paragraph mentioning struggling ‘in the playoffs and failing to reach the Super Bowl’ is equally unnecessary. https://t.co/Hps9tFi1uD
This has been eating away at me since Sunday. Kinda disappointed that @theweeknd didn’t do his verse from “Or Nah Remix” at the #SuperBowl. Weak.
@Notdonejr @NormRCN31 @MichaelBerrySho Whats wrong with ppl like Michael..
Bruce Arians has been trying to win a super Bowl for years...and finally did....That's fair.

People keep talking about #SRA and the #SuperBowl symbolism... I got news for ya. The only symbolism I would be worried about, is the music that we call “entertaining” - pop culture degrading women and the pimp culture that these stars indoctrinate our youth with.
Did anyone else watch the Super Bowl and think of the Longest Yard? Did the players throw the game?
Anyone who blames KC loss in the Super Bowl on Patrick Mahomes please do us all a favour and never watch or comment on football again as you clearly have no idea what you're talking about.

@creativeanthony @BMooreCreativ Time to move on from the Roman numero stuff. No one remembers if it’s 43, 12 or 37. I have an idea “super bowl 21”

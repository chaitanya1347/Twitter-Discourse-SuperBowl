@dunord I concur. His teams have been to four MLS Cups (RSL 2009, 2013) and TFC (2016, 2017). And notice it took the Eagles more than a decade to get back to the Super Bowl after he left. (Of course the other Mannings in the NFL have done better, albeit with more seasons to work with.)

@TonyDungy Mr. Dungy, you are truly loved by those here in Minnesota. What a journey from the Gophers, to the Vikings, to your Super Bowl win..and many stops in between. I’m so glad you can experience this Super Bowl with your son. It’s been fun watching it through his eyes.

@chrisgb00 1/3 of the adult population or so. The Super Bowl averages over 100 million for two teams that 99% of America doesn’t like. Let’s assume that 1/2 of that 45 million voted for someone else. Those numbers are low, 5 million lower that Obama’s 1st year.
Damn the super bowl never gonna be the same without Ashley lmfaooooooo
omg this west coast radio show said the Vikings couldn't make the Superbowl with Cousins because "the Redskins have a better roster than the Vikings."

I need a ruling on some Super Bowl party etiquette. Is it acceptable to take back your leftover food and booze from a party you go to or are you obligated to leave it there?

I was always under the impression don't bring what you're not willing to either consume or leave behind.

This city is definitely ready for the Super Bowl. Shame it wasn’t Vikings because this place would have been crazy.
Y’all, I don’t even drink anymore, but I may just drink me a few Sunday. Then I’d be more prepared to deal with all the Super Bowl BS. What id give to see the Eagle win that thing.

216 properly inflated special Wilson footballs will be ready for use in Sunday’s Super Bowl
@chuckwoolery Please do! That will be the only excitement and the only reason I would even watch the Super Bowl. To just see a bunch of BLM and Antifa go to jail. Now that would be a Superbowl.
I am so excited for the super bowl. If only my panthers where there. If only it wasn’t rigged for the Pats to win.

@42PhD @DScottAlexander I think the next 2-3 years is the last big push for the second ring for Payton. If they can’t at least get back to the Super Bowl, I would say Dallas or Houston become attractive to him.

I hope something in your life excites you as much as my 1st ever #curling experience did me. (Note: this was before I learned I'm not gonna make the @usacurl team.)

Some have asked, so here's the link to our winter road trip story:

So ready for the Super Bowl to be over so my job can go back to normal.
@baseballtwit @BravesStats You literally cannot talk to anyone in Philadelphia right now for more than 8 seconds without talking #SuperBowl and I’m no soccer fan, but I like the way you think outside of the box.

@CarolcatAnn @sweetgeorge48 @KittyLarson42 @KittyMcMurray1 @tickles_thecat @BarbaraMasnato I must know how my feline friends weigh in on the Super Bowl! Do u watch 4 the Eagles, the Pats, the ads, or pass on the whole thing? If it helps Gronk is pro cats &amp; kittens! Lol!
Yes... I’m still a @steelers fan, but they didn’t make it to the #SuperBowl. Maybe next year is the year where Pennsylvania will have both of their teams do so and then I can go to Atlanta. Gotta hope that happens. 🙏

Meanwhile at Justin Timberlake's house......

The weather folks said the wind chill at the Super Bowl in Minneapolis will be -19 degrees. What's the big deal? On two occasions when I was in Minneapolis covering the @dallasmavs, the wind chill was -20 once and -29 another time. Just put on some shorts  and keep on truckin'.
People are acting like Nick Foles has never played before this season. He was the starter for a few years in Philly. This is not his first go around. Just his first time in the super bowl.

It’s Feb 1st. And you know what that means...incessant replays of a supposed “catch” by Santonio Holmes in the endzone of Super Bowl XLIII. 🤢 Let’s just say that game always ends at 2:37 in the 4th for me.
With #SuperBowl just days away, Boston's Mayor is urging people to be smart about celebrations on Sunday.  @marty_walsh says he wants fans to be 'respectful out there, regardless what happens in the game, win or lose.'  This is the 3rd Superbowl since he took office.

I just realised this morning that I'm not at all excited about the Super Bowl this year, even with my team in the game. I haven't quite worked out why I feel this way. I think there's been a small seed of cynicism about the NFL that's grown over the last year.
@BrennanPalmer I constantly shovel food into my piehole for the entirety of each and every Super Bowl I watch, so that is not the issue, I can assure you
Super Bowl food is like my second Thanksgiving

It’s extremely depressing reading all these Super Bowl predictions. No one really gives the @eagles a chance many saying they are lucky to be there, lucky,

If I do wind up watching the Super Bowl this year, I’m going to rewatch Beyoncé’s performance from 2016 instead of watching Timberlake. Between him, Brady, and 45, there’s too much whiteness that I already have to deal with.
This extra week of the Super Bowl is really unnecessary and a money grab. Players are fatigued and you can tell they are beyond annoyed with Media day.
the Patriots pride themselves on being boring, and the eagles have zero stars. The best #SuperBowl story this week is Tom Brady lying about listening to Kendrick Lamar.

I didn't think so.
watching top chef and it shoots earlier in the year and it’s a super bowl theme so since the host city is denver, they’re at the broncos stadium with a broncos tailgate .... so sad bc wow were they bad this year
So who do you got winning the Super Bowl?

Nobody wants to see Tom Brady win another Super Bowl. Nick Foles needs to play as good as he did in the NFC Championship in the Super Bowl. Btw, Tom Brady proved that a backup QB can win the SB! We're counting on you @NickFoles_9 #FlyEaglesFly

At every #SuperBowl Week you run into amazing fan from all different teams and cities. My favorite fan base, don't laugh, Broncos fans, is Patriots. A couple of them started chanting State Farm jingle derisively towards my #PFM jersey and I reminded of AFCC record vs TB12.😈😂

Watching Bill Belichick look at the 4 Giants Super Bowl trophies was probably quite a poignant moment for him.  However his 5 as HC will probably suffice just fine.

You wont lose, but if you do just put in a tape of the other 5 Super Bowls for which you had a horseshoe up your ass. You’ll be fine.

ONE MORE THING, SUPER BOWL ADVERTISERS: Please don’t pander to Dreamers or the Me Too Movement if your product is deodorant, untucked shirts, a Kia Optima or nacho cheese fries.
@RobinBrenizer   See. 10 years ago tonight Tom Petty played at the halftime show at the Super Bowl.  His son Dylan was backstage tweeting. https://t.co/L0A3klxHGi
This Super Bowl kick off party is 🔥

J/K I'm just playing Donkey Kong in my basement.
I feel like I have to say this every year, but, I truly don’t give a fuck about the Super Bowl
@NFL This may be a dumb question...but..Why don't they host the Super Bowl in the the southern states?

In 6 seasons without Belichick -- New England &amp; Dallas -- Parcells lost more games than he has won. 

Belichick-less record = 44-47 

Without BB, Parcells and I are tied for # of playoff and Super Bowl wins: 🗣 Zero

If your upcoming Super Bowl commercial is just an incomplete one/third of a 6-minute gratuitous, self-indulgent “film project” where we have to go to YouTube to watch the rest, it’s not a commercial. It’s a shitty movie trailer for a product that probably shouldn’t have a movie.

Justin Timberlake said in a Super Bowl press conference that he’d never let his son play football and no one asked a follow-up. Meanwhile I told my family I wouldn’t let my future kids play football and they almost disowned me.

It’s the second quarter 10-7 pats. Foles hits Jeffery on a skinny post. Jeffery scores a 30 yard td. His celebration...the whole offense lifts up their jerseys and have “#freemeek” written on their white undershirts. Eagles go on to win the super bowl 33-27

Everyone points to Brady’s first Super Bowl as evidence of him being carried by his defense. Brady went 16 of 27 for 145 yds and 1 TD. But everyone fails to mention how in Montana’s first Super Bowl he was 14 of 22 for 157 yards and 1 TD. Very similar, very interesting.
Had to smile this morning, my wife is working the JFK to Minneapolis flight route today,she said lots of celebrities have been flying in for the Super Bowl. I asked her who, she replied “ I don’t know any of them, but if a Game Of Thrones actor is onboard I will let you know” 😂
@pattonoswalt I feel like this Super Bowl would be very rough on your character from Big Fan. Prayers.
A new @jtimberlake album makes for a happy Friday....*NSYNC joining him on stage at the Super Bowl will make for an even better Sunday! 😛💕🙌🏼 #wishfulthinking

Ask Alexa “who’s going to win the Super Bowl” is very entertaining. Then, ask her why she doesn’t like the Patriots. I may have to revisit my relationship with her. #Patriots #SuperBowl

@FoxNews Boycott Super Bowl and email the sponsors and let them know why you will buy someone else’s Products. We are stupid to buy from sponsors who pay millions to advertise at the SB and they ad it to the price that we flick to the stores to buy. Talk about Stupid American Shoppers.
@currentgraphics Can't wait to see what you have in store for #SuperBowl day!
I'm trying to want to watch the Super Bowl... but truly don't care. I haven't watched @espn  or @nflnetwork  in two weeks. I may have an issue.😔#ThatJagsLife

Have just been informed that "Eagles will win but the Patriots will catch the snitch" is not a valid Super Bowl wager because football "doesn't work like that". Whatever.
@MattyBigTime The baptism will be great content. I did say if Carson Wentz wins the super bowl but he and Nick are one so I think it transfers over
@seanthurmond @groughface Kids should be off limits. I’m not even sure why @Deadspin would post this. I guess they’re trying to piss him off enough to where he wins another super bowl.
Really wanted to see Carson Wentz play in the super bowl this year and get one, but I’m still going with Teflon Tom

@ave_mitchell21 The Jags did the same thing, Ramsey said they were going to the Super Bowl, and the Pats said you better back it up... In 2005 Bill used the facts that Philly was already planning the parade as motivation... idk it’s kinda risky

@wolverine66 @wvnottingham I’ve only been there once.  I’m a terrible native son.  I think Super Bowl Sunday should start with my second visit.
Pats win by one score. Philly plays well enough to make us care and end up disappointed even tho we don’t have a vested interest. My advice is to drink some good beer, eat some bad food, and enjoy the Super Bowl spectacle.
I was curious how the Eagles playing in the Super Bowl might effect this year's Wing Bowl... Howard Stern always has top notch coverage.

@ThePerezHilton @ChrisBooker This is why im saying he shouldn’t have done the super bowl.
Nixon was forced to resign or face impeachment and removal from office in 1974. The Super Bowl in 1974 was between Miami and Minnesota! The Super Bowl this year, 2018, is being played in Minnisota. See the similarities? trump will resign when he faces impeachment and removal! YES

A Super Bowl stat that almost made me do a double take......in 7 #SuperBowl starts, #TomBrady has never led the Patriots on a scoring drive in the first quarter
Truer words were never spoken.

Remember he took a Browns roster &amp; turned them into 2x Super Bowl Champs. https://t.co/Aw8bn7ELsC
Apparently, @Amazon wants me to discover @RebelWilson and Cardi  B, two stars in the #SuperBowl ad I had never heard of until today.
I’m in no way wishing that Tom Brady gets hurt during the Super Bowl. But if for whatever reason he does and we get Brian Hoyer v Nick Foles battling it out for the Lombardi Trophy, I will cry actual tears of joy.
The @Eagles are going to crush the @Patriots , even #amazonalex knows! #FlyEaglesFly #SuperBowl https://t.co/TUJPDtu5sc

My take on The 2 Bills @30for30:
1. Belichick has a sick Maryland accent.
2. Joe Gibbs is still the 🐐. He won the Super Bowl with 3 different QB’s. And almost another with Jay Schroeder. Then dominated @NASCAR.

The Eagles are playing in the Super Bowl in two days and it's becoming impossible for me to contain how hype I am
The thing I’ve enjoyed most about having the Super Bowl invade my office building is going up to strangers and pretending that I think they’re someone famous. 

Me: “Oh, my god. You’re Al Roker!” 
Not Al Roker: “Sorry, I’m not Al Roker.”
Me: “Whatever, Roker. Sign my shirt!”
A couple weeks ago I started to get excited about the super bowl because of Frito chili pie... Then I realized I'm (sort of) an adult and can have frito chili pie whenever, I've eaten it 6 times since then

@Shane_YOYO @danorlovsky7 @TheAthleticDET @cmonarrez Exactly. Read @danorlovsky7 article. It’s great. Several steps on how to make a super bowl. Contrast that to @cmonarrez which boils down to “trade three best players AND 1st/2nd rd draft picks “ and then try to make super bowl. Uh ... I’m siding with Mr Orlovsky on this one !

The Eagles are coming out to Dreams and Nightmares by Meek Mill for the Super Bowl? Philly by 40.
Can’t imagine how Carson Wentz feels. He’s hurt while his team is in the Super Bowl and there’s nothing he can do about that. Man is humble and full of character out there on the sidelines cheering his team on.

Super Bowl team?
tired: “sportsball”, i only watch it for the commercials, suburb owl 

wired: a 67 page polemic of reasons why it is good and proper to watch the Super Bowl as a New York Giants fan and root for the stadium to collapse or as compromise, Tom Brady getting mauled by a lion

I plan on watching the Super Bowl this weekend however if I see or catch wind that any of these football players disrespecting national anthem and our flag my TV set will be immediately turned off
I was supposed to have 6 hours of meeting today. 5 hours of those were cancelled. God bless the Minneapolis Super Bowl, but I pity the poor souls that have to spend their weekend at -10 degrees. #whatwerethey thinking
Dow closed -666, Trump is #POTUS, and the #Patriots could win their 6th Super Bowl. The end may well be nigh.
What a pathetic, misfiring McGuffin this memo is.  They know it, too.  That’s why they released it on the Friday afternoon before the Super Bowl.
Patriots &amp; the Eagles have officially released their Injury Reports, and all players originally in question have been removed from it. Both teams will be a full go for Super Bowl LII. https://t.co/2l9iOhTk5C

Debating if I should bet on the super bowl 🧐🧐
Pretty amazing in hindsight ... Chip Kelly had a reputation as an innovator, when he was actually a divisive 1-trick poney. People thought Doug Pederson was a flake, when in reality he was a unifying offensive innovator. Now he’s in the #SuperBowl. #Eagles https://t.co/FKDsjXhteZ

There are no #Patriots or #Eagles on the final Super Bowl injury report.

After much debating and internal struggle I have decided to root for New England in the Super Bowl. I can't,as a #Giants fan, in good conscience root for the Eagles. Not a fan of the Pats but I recognize greatness and we are watching it w Belichick and Brady. Still 0-2 v NYG tho!

Patriots have never scored an offensive point in the first quarter of a Super Bowl. They have combined with their opponents for 15 total first-quarter points in seven Super Bowl attempts. It's weird, doesn't sound possible but it's true.
@1500ESPN_Reusse Patrick, is Belichick the Phil Jackson of the NFL?  I mean, Brady has pulled his ass out how many times in the Super Bowl?  Seriously, New England is perhaps a little above average, at best in half their SB’s, but this clown gets credit for being a genius.

Hi @TheMattBongiovi I have to ask ... What team are you feeling for the Superbowl? Just wondering 🏈😄
It might be Super Bowl weekend but, I got some baseball video watching to do#Hotstoveleauge
@jimshorts93 The running backs on eagles roster... clement undrafted.. Blount undrafted... Ajayi 4th round.. y’all are in the SuperBowl
@darrenrovell You're right. The NFL uses the lure of hosting a super bowl to convince cities to invest billions to build a new stadium. Then it's one and done, until the process repeats itself. #superscam
#SuperBowl = A shit ton of eating and some Ultra 👌🏽👌🏽

Chiefs winning Super Bowl &gt; than royals winnings the World Series? Would the city burn to the ground??
@crabwizard Better then this yrs Super bowl.
@NFL C. Doug Pederson 

He is headed to the Superbowl in his second year. He inherited a team without any superstars from Chip Kelly and changed the culture. He developed a 2nd year QB into an MVP and got veteran coaches with HC aspirations to buy in and trust his management style.
@ImDanEdwards Using the Super Bowl as a quid pro quo has a shelf life, unfortunately.

@kimbartmann Crickets? I can extrapolate the meaning, but never heard this term before. And yes, the whole NFL SuperBowl lie - pathetic hype to get tax breaks and perks for one of the biggest parties of the year for the uber-wealthy. And as usual, trickle down? Not.

Just watched "The Two Bills" on @espn @30for30. Bill Belichick is going to his 8th #SUPERBOWL as HC. He was Def Cor for 2 SBs with Giants. He was also an Asst Coach with the Pats '96 season. / Bill has been to the SB as a coach 11 times. BB has been a coach in 1 out of 5 SBs.
So done with the Super Bowl and the Patriots. Bored with the same team all the time. Hmm...
is EDP having a live stream for the super bowl? I'd watch that shit

Pretty solid distribution of people in Chicago heading to Minnesota for the #SuperBowl 33% Patriots, 33% Philly, 33% hate both teams.
I'd be in favor of a Miami/New Orleans/Phoenix/Vegas rotation for the Super Bowl. Warm weather destinations that can handle the influx of tourists without having to completely redesign their infrastructure is better than using the SB as bait for cities to build new stadiums.

@BreitbartNews I’m goin down on both knees tomorrow hoping the wings are Super Bowl worthy because though I like both teams I have no interest watching these shitshow wannabe politicians play football but still need to eat the wings #FCKTHENFL
With the Superbowl tomorrow I just realized @AchievementHunt didn't make a prediction video. I look forward to it every year and now my team is in they didn't make one. Guess I'll just have to watch all the other amazing content they make to fill the void.
I predict that Roger Goodell will get Superbowl MVP
The stinkin super bowl is tomorrow. The eagles are in it. Go birds

I completely forgot the Super Bowl is tomorrow 😂
Para terminar #datopersonal aunque me gustaría que ganaran las Águilas, creo que la hegemonía y el valor de tener a Tom Brady les da el favoritismo a los Patriotas #Superbowl

#SuperBowlMonday needs to be a new federal holiday to recover from how late we stay up to watch the #SuperBowl and the heartache or celebration if our team wins or loses. Let's get it trending and make Congress work for us.

@mikewickett I totally agree about GB never getting a Super Bowl. But I think Darren is mistaken about this being the last in Minnesota. There’s no way they built a billion $+ stadium to not have a Super Bowl there every 5-7 years. Minnesota will campaign hard.
To be or not to be...on the list...that is the question..I'm head to the #Superbowl ticket will call window to find out🤞 https://t.co/G73wfo6a6H
When watching the #SuperBowl, know in past, when NFC wins, S&amp;P 500 ended year higher 22 of 27x (82%) vs. AFC’s 15 of 24x (63%).  Also, In those yrs., average yearly price gains were 11% vs 6% respectfully.  Just another reason to root for the #Eagles!
It has now been 10 years since the greatest catch in Super Bowl history was made in the greatest Super Bowl in Super Bowl history. I’m grateful for that game because it is one of the reasons I fell in love with the New York Giants. #SBXLII #GiantsPride

@EaglesWinItAll @Mike__McGuire @Colin_P_Bradley @handsomejawn @budlight @Lanejohnson65 @Ike58Reese Entitlement?

And when they win you tell him to pay up.
I think everyone should be standardly unimpressed by award SZN/super bowl cause it’s the same old tired shit people

@TheSchurThing Like Burton over 1.5 catches. Super Bowl has a history of nondescript TE showing up in the thick of it (e.g., Max McGee, Randy Grossman, Jackie Smith (oops), Mike Vrabel, Kevin Boss).

Hey so apparently the Super Bowl is this weekend
Not watching the super bowl cuz it’s just gonna be the patriots down by 80 in the 4th quarter but then Tom Brady’s gonna warp the time space continuum and make the eagles never have existed in the first place and the patriots rule the world
And if I may be so bold as to position myself as a tiebreaker, I also come down in the #Eagles corner when I argue that this Philly defense is built perfectly to stop New England: https://t.co/X2KZhdutcM

I know I’m a grumpy media member, but Snapchat Story is pretty much out of my routine. Little pro value in sharing stories. Use it just to mess around with friends. Any story content from #SuperBowl week went on my Instagram Story, where I have a more public following. #sportsbiz
Tomorrow is #SuperBowl and my Grandfather's 65th birthday
@FoxNews curious as to why so much hipe for the super bowl after all the hate &amp; disrespect shown by the NFL &amp; its players to our great country &amp; flag. Very disappointed
And following a train of thought, I think I’d rather watch its central broadcast than see Prince resurrected against his will to perform at the Super Bowl. Screw that.

The @NFL has long corroborated our implicit biases about who can run fast and who can read a defense. This year, it corroborated our biases about who deserves to live and die. 

Not even the Super Bowl can distract from that.

Let's be real here for a sec #Philly, we never do well when we are the favorites. I find some strange satisfaction seeing most pundits not giving the @Eagles a shot, and am looking forward to seeing our boys insulted, pissed, and amped tomorrow for #SuperBowl

Super Bowl prediction: 2 minutes left in the 4th. Patriots ball. Tom Brady goes 8/8 on the drive. Scores a TD with 0:14 left. Eagles win 30-17.
Big fan of the #SJSharks playing on Super Bowl Sunday 🤘🏼

@PhilWhi7 @HaloTopCreamery Yea I’ve officially decided ur hosting a super bowl halo top party.
I betcha @realDonaldTrump fires #RobRosenstein before the #SuperBowl so he can compete with the #ratings. The #TrumpCrimeFamily has nothing to lose by his #Treason He knows is is #winning and hates the #NFL His real bosses think about this stuff. #Putin #FLOTUS #FlippingFlynn
Okay if my neighbors are #pregaming for a #SuperBowl that doesn't kick off until tomorrow night? This could get ugly. Or they'll sleep through the game
Just imagine if Cam Newton was the one playing in this Superbowl and he beat Brady for the 3rd time with practice squad players. Still undefeated against Brady. If that wouldn’t earn him more respect nothing ever will.

If the Prince Super Bowl hologram rumors are true, Imma need Justin Timberlake to stop bringin black performers into his halftime show to humiliate. Not our fault he doesn’t think he’s good enough to perform on this large a platform by himself. Call a Living white friend yo.

what’s a super bowl and how much soup can it hold
about Super Bowl, I confess. I do have it on.  
for the commercials and half time, rest of time sound is down and I am reading.  I can hear crowd if anything big happens, then they conveniently replay for me.
win, win, know what goes on w/o having to watch football
I haven’t been sick for around two years and of course here I am with a fever during Super Bowl weekend. I think the #patriots gods heard I was sick of their news coverage and are punishing me

Hi my name is Megan and not only did I go to Walmart and the market after work, but I went during prime shopping time on a Saturday, but also on the first weekend of the month AND Super Bowl weekend. 

I am an idiot.

Just posted a photo @ Minnesota Super Bowl 2018 https://t.co/FT6nwmUiMZ
I can see it now...

Prince’s hologram “malfunctions” at Justin Timberlake’s Super Bowl LII performance. Prince’s hologram must immediately apologize and will feel the ramifications of this incident for years to come. Justin will side step responsibility per usual. 

Don’t u dare https://t.co/bThFTPTz8A
@WLMiller2  👋 Hi! I agree with You on Just About Everything! I’m even following You Now cause I do! All Except for One ☝️ Item: I Won’t Boycott the SuperBowl Cause Of a Few Bad Apple’s 🍏! First time I’ve been able to afford to watch it (thanks to Trumps COLI To SSI!) #MAGA

@dak says he’s cheering for the Patriots and says he is anti-eagle, well Dak the feeling is mutual, and instead of cheering against the Eagles why don’t you play better and win the super bowl based on your own talent

One of my top wishes for the super bowl halftime show is for Justin not to sing that song from Trolls. I hate that song

@jtimberlake could've ended this whole controversy by bringing on @JanetJackson during his Super Bowl show and put on a show - but that would be too obvious.

@ajm0919 Didn’t I just say with Wentz being injured gave him the MVP. Also, Wentz pretty much put the Eagles in the super bowl. Foles played good in the 2 playoff games but Wentz put them in that position.
@NFL @Patriots The Eagles were able to make the Super Bowl because of home field advantage and Wentz was the sole reason moreover Patriots fans are hypocrites since last year they wanted Brady to win after missing the first four games which Pats went 3-1 during that stretch

Tom Brady has never won the Super Bowl the same season he has won MVP #FlyEaglesFly https://t.co/JFti6k8IKs
Catch me watching Invincible tomorrow instead of the Super Bowl. Better chance for an Eagle victory
My cousin’s dog is on the first annual Dog Bowl, we’re all super pumped about it 🐶🐶
where’s the part where they were supposed to make minneapolis cool for the super bowl
@BrandonVine @Mucinex I’ve always favored the idea of the Super Bowl being played Saturday night.Then we have Sunday to recuperate. New Year’s Eve we party, then we  have New Year’s Day to get over it.
Tried going to Costco the day before the Super Bowl. 

I have seen too much of mankind now. https://t.co/2njn43rm7F
Will NFL players protest Super Bowl National Anthem tomorrow?

Can we talk about how messed up it is that @NBC is airing the episode where we learn about a fatal fire in This Is Us after the Super Bowl? It sounds like such a buzz kill. That's coming from a fan.
Fuimos al restaurante de la esquina, adónde nos conocen. La mesera nos pregunta que si vamos a ver el superbowl mañana. Le decimos que meh, que elecciones en CR y le damos un resumen breve de la situación. La mae procede a enviarnos una ronda de tragos cortesía de la casa.
@RoobNBCS This team must win The Super Bowl with all this dis-respect
@nickwallace7 @HoboMcCoy Ohh so wait we worship Brady for making the Super Bowl (even when he losses) but Lebron sucks for losing in the finals. I see what your saying

But seriously Sean McKay, OUT STANDING coach. But where is he this weekend ? Doug and front office transformed a defense and offense and made them a super bowl team down KEY KEY players but the young buck younger then some players gave the rams a winning season he's the COY. 🤔

Turned on the TV earlier and found "Concussion". Very sobering movie to watch the day before Super Bowl Sunday.
This is the last Super Bowl I will miss due to the army. Mark my words. #ETSlife
Looks like I will be watching Super Bowl LII after all. And for a day, I will root for the New England Patriots because they are the better team to win this.
Check out your numbers!  https://t.co/rwXZvhVesO
Idc what commercials come on DURING the SuperBowl - @Febreze_Fresh wins the commercial contest right now 😂🥇🏆🏈
I’m also ridiculously superstitious so the fact Brady didn’t win the Super Bowl his other two MVP years makes me nervous
@RoobNBCS Name one other second year coach who led his team to the Superbowl (after suffering the injuries the Eagles endured).
It's Ok!  Last 7 QBs who won the MVP &amp; played in that year's Super Bowl have lost. https://t.co/XIimwsdY73

@ACwhite1138 I can believe it. I see that the NFL didn't want to screw Brady out of a "title" after that Super bowl and being embrassed really hurts. Tod Gurley was good but not enough to carry the momentum for the offense. Other than that, no one else was really MVP expect for Carson Wentz
I'd love to see @jtimberlake come out in lighted armor to dance to #Filthy for his opening act for the #SuperBowl half time show. That dude has talent for sure!!! Moves I'd love to have..... choreographer or not, that man has talent!!!!! Come on JT!!!!!!!!

@TeresaNWORLEANS @people When it came out that he would be performing at the Super Bowl everybody was pissed that Janet wasn't performing with him look farther back on the news feeds. Read the news not your opinion.

I know you can’t EVER “count TB12 out” of the game. However, I think Philly wins by 8 or more points.

Eagles v Patriots...

How many Huskers per team? Eagles - Nate Gerry. Anyone else? Patriots - Rex Burkhead, Vincent Valentine. Anyone else?

Love it when TINA Fay throws out an “Iggles” on SNL the night before the Super Bowl. Go EAGLES 🦅

@ShawnMendes are you watching the super bowl tomorrow and if you are who are you routing for??
@BlueHorseshoeLV @tbeartim Horrible scheduling spot for Golden St. Goid job with ml. I just grabbed the points. Very similar to Minnesota in NHL tonight. Beat vegas last night fly to Dallas then back for Super Bowl. Wild got crushed.

Super bowl for all us gamblers. Good luck boys. Last game I’m going big on for a long long time. Eagles + 170. Let’s get it. Good luck gentlemen.

When a cute boy invites you to his Super Bowl party tomorrow🙌🏼
Just think, there is (or probably already) going to be a crap ton of famous people 2 to 3hrs away from us for the super bowl.
@EricTrump Seriously? Getting only 55% of the sycophant vote is hardly something to brag about, perhaps a bumble-brag or in honor of the Super Bowl lets call it a fumble-brag.
If and when the Eagles win the Super Bowl just know I can literally die the happiest girl on the planet
My Lineup For Tomorrow Is Amazing 🔥 Church , Party At My Job , Party At My House , Party Everywhere Else 🤣😂😂😂😁🤗🤗 Can't Wait . Superbowl Sunday Cannot Come Quick Enough .
Pros of not going to any Super Bowl parties: 
- no people
- no awkward conversations
- more time to gush over the Puppy Bowl 
Cons:
- no free chip dip

8 Modelos and 5 grams of OG for the Superbowl should be a good game
Y'all got me so confused. Are we going to boycott the NFL or we watching the Superbowl?
I was invited to 8 parties
And are we gone free Kodak this time or what?

Excellent #StillProcessing ep on Janet Jackson, Justin Timberlake, &amp; the Super Bowl Halftime Show. Felt anxious listening to the audio clips, knowing what was coming, but they talked me through it. Truly poetic justice to end w/appreciation of Janet. @jennydeluxe @Wesley_Morris
Watching last years #SB51 highlights and wonder like every year why #WorldChampions if there is only one country competing? #SuperBowl

@cookieinureyez U better call me 2morrow,no excuses! We'll have a super bowl..lol
My NFL Conference Championship prediction results were 1-1, bringing my playoff total to 5-5 (.500). It brings my 17-18 season total to 166-100 (.624).

My Super Bowl prediction is NE beating PHI 31-14. I think Brady will win Super Bowl MVP. I am rooting for PHI.

Thanks for nothing @warriors . @PelicansNBA could have used the #1 team in the NBA to handle the current 8 seed in West. Not having Boogie is almost as bad as watching the Super Bowl tomorrow knowing what could have been.
Unfortunate news. 99 year old Millie Wall, the Vikings fan who captured the hearts of many, won't be able to attend the Super Bowl after being gifted tickets by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell. @WCCO https://t.co/e237eUp2RW

Oh by the way Patriots win 35-21. The only way I’ll totally get into the super bowl game is if Carson Wentz miraculously comes back and plays in the second half and all the North Dakota State Bison fans rock that Dome to the ground. #BlackClover

@Chizzy_GetsBusy Yeah but like I said they don’t count playoffs so it’s just the regular season.  They already had these awards set. They for some reason have tied them to the Super Bowl weekend now but before they would announce them at the end of the season cause the season is the measurement
#Retweet if you feel #SuperBowl #weekend should be a #ThreeDayWeekend and a #NationalHoliday!

@alex_buscemi @_Music_Is_Lyfe @SteadyLosing I hope he lose the Superbowl now with his weird ass.
So where we watching the @SuperBowl tomorrow ? 🤔 🍻
@NCPCall I love that score but the Pats have never won by more than 6 in a Super Bowl. Their average win is by less than 5 points. I would love a Pats blowout so I don’t have to have high anxiety all game! Go Pats! 24-20 final.
@TheMightyEROCK Think of it this way. Would you rather have the coach of the year and team that got eliminated in the WC round or the guy who didn’t win coaching your team in the Super Bowl? Easy answer.

My pick for the Superbowl will always be greatness. I hate underdog stories. I want to see why greatness is great! I want to see LeBron beat the warriors. I want to see Tom Brady win all the Superbowls. It's just the better story. Plus I like the cowboys so fuck the eagles ok bye

Thank you - Darrin
Am I the only one who doesn’t know who’s playing in the Super Bowl tomorrow?
Jon Dorenbos’ Snapchat of Sharyl Crow singing at the super bowl 52 party just made me legit cry
It's Super Bowl Sunday and I'm honestly not surely when I'll be cracking my first beer today. Def after lunch. Probably with lunch.

@celebraterecvry Thank you, today is my 5 year alcohol free. The @SuperBowl has a lot to do with it actually, the day after the SB 5 years ago I quit drinking and never looked back. 👌🙏🏻☝️☂️🔑
@trip_zero @TheTeawrex As a patriots fan, I honestly wouldn’t mind seeing the eagles win a super bowl... obviously I want the pats to win, but it wouldn’t bother me either way... but with that being said, Foles will need to play the game of his career to defeat tom Brady.
Waking up at 4am on SuperBowl Sunday to go to work for 8hours when I’m normally off isn’t fun or easy...but 8 hours being paid double makes me do it🙂😳
I really hope Philly wins it tonight; I’m tired of the Pats already

Usually wake up excited for game on Super Bowl Sunday, but today I feel like I did when UC &amp; UK played a couple years ago...is a double disqualification possible so neither team wins?
To those attending the @SuperBowl, have fun waiting in line outside and going through multiple checkpoints in sub-zero temperatures and wind chills so bad that frostbite occurs in less than 30 minutes. But hey, at least the players will be warm, playing inside. #SB52 #SuperBowl

Super Bowl Sunday! I guess just for this once, Fly Eagles Fly 🦅. But really, GO STEELERS!
Boycotting the NFL. In lieu of the Super Bowl there are other, more respectable programs to watch. PGA Golf from Phoenix, the news, Carnival Eats, 60 Minutes, repeats of NCIS. Anything is better than football. For those who can’t resist the urge...get a life!!

M, ? ?, m m
The patter implies mathematics 
Sides have been picked
Picked a side
Philly  NE
Cards shuffled
Many human exchanges
So since 19 out of 20 people nationwide hate the patriots I thought I would drop this picture right here. #SuperBowlLII #SuperBowl https://t.co/BqwBnfNHz1

Look! Tom Brady and the Patriots won another Super Bowl! #TweetLikeThe2000s
If you don’t own any patriots gear, can you wear your one Celtics shirt to a super bowl party? Asking for a friend...
Honestly if the puppy bowl had the same commercials as the Super Bowl, I wouldn't even need to watch football today.

@MCNerdacles I specifically meant the people who ONLY do it today to act like they’re “better” than the people who like to watch the super bowl, not people who use it for all sports all the time.

The Patriots to wax the floor with the Eagles because Philadelphia fans don’t deserve to win anything, ever.

I voted #FlyEaglesFly on @TheTylt because Philly can bring down the evil empire! https://t.co/7OPr7XbC6t https://t.co/9Br4io8253
still waiting for the year the @ChicagoBears make it to the super bowl
the Super Bowl doesn’t want her https://t.co/qxJcH4vbup
@dallascowboys How about y’all focus this much on getting to a Super Bowl or beating your division rivals to keep them from getting there! Y’all had a month head start to prepare for following season I hope y’all took advantage. #GoPats
If the Pats lose to fucking Nick Foles in the Super Bowl im going to violently barf until next season starts.
Creighton is 7-2 all-time on Super Bowl Sunday. Important one for the #Jays at-large chances about to tip-off at Marquette.

I ain’t betting shxt this Super Bowl I was hit last year after that game it’s a no go 🙅🏾‍♂️🙅🏾‍♂️🙅🏾‍♂️🙅🏾‍♂️😒
In conclusion: bagging on @MetroTransitMN for super bowl headaches is like shitting on Melania for the election result. It was our job to stop it, not theirs.
Rooting for the Eagles as a #giants fan?.. No fan at all.. 5 reasons..

#1. Its the Eagles
#2. Giants have beat the Pats twice in the Super bowl.
3. Eli is the only QB to have beat Brady in the SB.
4. Its the fucking Eagles.
5. Its the fucking Eagles. https://t.co/TVQZFK0Flk

Does anyone have 0 or negative super bowl plans?

Please make plans now for getting home safely from your Super Bowl party.
Ride sharing is too easy. No excuses.
Please, don’t drive slightly buzzed. Or drunk.

I've been an Eagles fan my whole life and year after year my realization that I could go my entire life without seeing an Eagles Super Bowl seemed more and more true. If that comes to an end tonight, I am not sure how I will feel but I'm ready for it #flyeaglesfly

Maybe some @Eagles player will fart in Tom Brady's mouth when they sack him. That would be amazing. That's all I really want out of this game. Go Eagles! Fart in Brady's mouth! #Eagles #SuperBowl

I can’t believe Kylie Jenner saved us from the most boring Super Bowl Sunday in history. An icon.
Life is full of many tough decisions. Today, February 4th, 2018, I have decided to root for the Patriots in the Super Bowl. Can’t deny that Tom Brady is the best to ever do it #PatriotsNation
Can Minneapolis host the Super Bowl ever other year??? I love this!

- Foles gets injured, double backup Nate Sudfeld QB leads a game winning drive to win for PHI
- Pats win from down 25 points again
- Triple Overtime
- Pats win exactly 28-3

The drama between the Patriots and the Eagles is intense. On the one hand, you have the Eagles, who haven’t won a single Super Bowl in 52 years. On the other hand, the Patriots are going to absolutely dominate today and it will be no big deal for them.

@btrain92 I believe the Patriots will be hard to beat especially after the win they pulled off last Super Bowl.  They seem to have the “mojo”. If Wentz were playing, it may be a different game. I do like Foles, but a bit of an underdog in this situation.

Haven't watched football in TWO years, so this back-to-back super bowl for the Patriots doesn't excite me. #SorryNotSorry #KanyeShrug But glad to spend time with my family! #SuperPARTYBowl

They keep calling the Super Bowl half time show “Music’s Biggest Moment of the Year” and I’m offended. Football thinks pretty highly of itself.
Did the NFL abolish defenses and kickers for the Super Bowl this year?
In honor of all these sports people on the band field: ITS THE SUPER BOWL PEOPLE YOU CANT BE MISSING A FIELD GOAL

the current bets on the table at this super bowl party:

- one of us becomes a trophy wife by the game’s end
- the opposing coaches kiss at the end
- JC Chasez will desperately cling on to his former back up dancer/singer glory during halftime (this person lost)
That might be one of the greatest throws I’ve ever seen in the Super Bowl
Lol so like I don’t care for either team in the super bowl but I have money on this game.

this super bowl lowkey boring
It's not rocket science...TOUCHDOWN @Eagles @NewsRadio930 #SuperBowl
The NFL Rules Committee needs to re-do the whole Catch/No Catch thing. Chris Collinsworth &amp; Al Michaels are losing their minds over every TD play... #SuperBowl
They got it right! ITS A FUCKING MIRACLE. #FlyEaglesFly #SuperBowl

My favorite #SuperbOwl!! @natgeo https://t.co/eARGVqaYvE

It’s only fitting that the #SuperBowl hangs on what is or is not a catch
Why is this even a question? He carried the ball 5 yards into the end zone. #SuperBowl
Faith has been restored #SuperBowl
They got it right!!! No arguing that. #SuperBowl
NBC’s lack of a rules specialist is glaring tonight. #SuperBowl
If this is called back it will be evidence of Russian collusion with Belichick. #SuperbOwl
Hey @NFL, unfuck your catch rules ASAP #SuperBowl #EaglesVsPatriots
Bad call.

The NFL rule book clearly states that you cannot score a touchdown in the last 3 minutes in the Super Bowl against the Patriots.
No matter the call @nflcommish needs to clearly define what a catch is before next season #Superbowl

The worst part of the #SuperBowl is being forced to listen to the commentators stroke Tom Brady's ego.
If that was a handoff it’s a TD, no question. He broke the plane with the ball. Touchdown. #SuperBowl
He was a runner. It’s a touchdown. #Superbowl
#Steeler fans are about to go nuts #SuperBowl https://t.co/bXDOZbheiG
This announcer is the Bill Walton of the NFL. #superbowl
That is a touchdown. #SuperBowl
I can hear my neighbours cheering vigorously every time their team scored a goal or whatever you guys call it with this strange sports. #SuperBowl

That catch was crazy. Well deserved touchdown! #SuperBowl
That's a catch man!!! Cris Collinsworth is really pissing me off with his commentary...#SuperBowl
Brands need to spend all year doing good things and being involved in communities.  You don’t get to just bring it up in the Super Bowl.
Great TD. But Philly left Brady waaaaaay too much time. #SuperBowl
Do you go for two? #SuperBowl
That’s absolutely a touchdown @Eagles he is a runner. Broke the plane. The end #SuperBowl
Nick Foles and the Eagles offense delivered a performance of a lifetime tonight. Brady will get his chance at a response in yet another memorable Super Bowl ending, one way or the other. #superbowl
The commentary on this touchdown review is so one sided. He takes 3 steps then dives into the endzone. This is where we figure out who’s side the #NFL is on... #Superbowl
This replay determines my future as a NFL fan. #SuperBowl
That’s a catch...2 feet and a football move. #SuperBowl https://t.co/nFioLdaCX4
That's a catch. BS if they call this back. #SuperBowl
For this TD to be in question at all is Fuckin CRAZY #NFL #SuperBowl #Collinsworth sucks
(Falcons fans watching the Super Bowl) https://t.co/rNnSHV0daS
Toooooooouuuuccccchhhjj dddddooooowwwwnnn Eagles 🦅 #SuperBowl #SBLII
This is phenomenal. The NFL has complicated what a catch is in the game of football. Just think about that.
#SuperBowl
THIS IS NOT THE JESSE JAMES PLAY

Two steps. Football move. Stretch. He’s a runner. By rule, as soon as the ball crosses the plane it’s a TD. This is easy. #SuperBowl
Just as with my political comments, my @SuperBowl reactions are relegated to Twitter to prevent comments by *crazy* relatives and acquiantances (whose ideologies differ from mine).
Zach Ertz is one of the better TEs in @NFL on the outside against a DB and he made #Patriots secondary pay w/ go-ahead TD #SuperBowl
He caught the ball twice. Give him 2 TDs #Eagles #SuperBowl
give the Eagles 3.75 points and let’s get this show on the road. 

#SuperBowl
@ClayTravis No super bowl ring because of a stupid rule!
These @nfl rules are asinine #superbowl
That had to be a catch, then fumble to me. Regardless, @nfl needs to make it easier. Everyone knows that should be a TD like a running back. #SuperBowl
He caught. Took 2 steps. Scored the f'n TD. #superbowl #ShutUPAl
HE WAS A RUNNER. Took about 4 steps with control. Should be a touchdown. #SuperBowl
I voted #FlyEaglesFly on @TheTylt because Philly can bring down the evil empire! https://t.co/Ru40HAgAr2 https://t.co/1d6ZQHIq46
If that’s not a catch and a touchdown I don’t even know what we’re doing here. #SuperBowl
The fact that there is any question if this is a TD is why viewership is down. #SUPERBOWL #NFL
The suspense is killing us. Was it Good? #Eagles #superbowl
He had control and was a runner.  TD #SuperBowl
That man caught the ball took steps got hit and started diving. Why they making this so hard #SuperBowl
Homeland Security is telling the NFL to call this a catch to save Philly from blowing up. #SuperBowl
I think you’re an idiot #Collinsworth #SuperBowl #ESPN
I forgot to post the pups watching the #superbowl - da iggles, of course! 😂 https://t.co/yQ85Nyubuy
Oh my gosh! Collinsworth is a moron! #NFL #SuperBowl Ertz has possession and crosses the End zone!!
To me, that wasn’t in process of the catch, he caught it took two steps and than actively jumped into end zone therefore it’s a TD. But it’s the Patriots #SuperBowl
38-33 come on Philly  #SuperBowl
Happy Sunday... #superbowl #santacruz #whatgame @ Natural Bridges… https://t.co/Y7wefQWzFf
#SuperBowl #PepsiHalftime #SweepstakesEntry https://t.co/kBSzPhyn0K
Collinsworth, shut up. He makes the catch and takes multiple steps and the ball crosses the goal line. It’s a TD. #SuperBowl
#Alexa please tell #NBC to fire #ChrisCollinsworth #SuperBowl
Both questionable catches are against the #Patriots , Jesse James &amp; Zach Ertz know the feeling. #SuperBowl they need to clear up what's a catch next season..
Omg #SuperBowl
Only a catch when it's not against the Patriots. #superbowl
Lol y’all are watching the super bowl like the Dow didn’t just drop 666 pts on Friday https://t.co/C7c09nMmbZ
lol, what the hell are they reviewing?  That's a touchdown  #SuperBowl
Ground caused the fumble and he had control. That's a touchdown #FlyEagleFly @KristinChristy #superbowl
that is definitely a #td! #SuperBowl

3 steps then crossed the plane, it’s not hard! #SuperBowl
If they overturn this, I’m completely done with this stupid league. #superbowl
This is the "Rigged" Moment Of the Game! #SuperBowl
What is happening to football 🏈???? I'm confused , ain't this a TD wtf #superbowl
This kind of play in the #SuperBowl is exactly what the @NFL deserves. Fuck the catch rule
If this gets over turned AND ruled an incomplete pass I give up.  #superbowl
Loved this feel-good spot. Well done, @Hyundai #AAFChalkTalk #SuperBowl https://t.co/w7k4VrBBOn
But was there goaltender interference? #SuperBowl
I'm tired of these announcers, can they kiss the #Patriots asses any more? #SuperBowl #SuperBowlLII
Somewhere in the #superbowl stadium, @jaketapper is having heart palpitations.
He's a runner. Touchdown #SuperBowl
He was stupid to stretch out on that, knowing if that ball is jarred loose the  call is possibly incomplete. He should’ve tucked it in. May have still been a TD or would’ve been first and goal #SuperBowl
He took three steps with the ball! It’s a catch. #superbowl
Can’t be a Patriots Super Bowl without a controversial call that possibly gives them a chance. #FuckFheRules
Regardless of how this game ends how does @NFoles_9 go back to being a backup QB? If he does that’s has to be one of the top 1-2 QB line up in the past decade with @cj_wentz comes back full recovery @nfl @SuperBowl #superbowl
He was a runner at the point he crossed the goal line #super bowl
This call will decide the Super Bowl
There is Noooooo ? here, Its a TD!!! #SuperBowl
That is a touchdown!!! #SuperBowl
Touchdown? #SuperBowl https://t.co/3WPPNZuC64

ground can’t cause a fumble

My wife said it was a catch and TD and she never watches football...let's keep the game rolling #superbowl
The ground popped it up!!! 😒#SuperBowl
Call it a TD you fucks. #SuperBowl #Ertz
@DarlingSpectrum Honestly I’d rather be at home watching the super bowl than here at work where there’s a guy that’s hella creepy that I had to call the police 😨😨😭😓 I’m kinda scared ahaha. He’s not afraid to come in the back room 😱😱😱
All I’m saying is somehow the Patriots always end up in one of these situations 🤔 #SuperBowl #SB52
#SuperBowl https://t.co/vNola0GHZY
No one has any idea what a catch is so this call could literally be anything. I might need a Xanax. #SuperBowl
If that isn't a #Touchdown, then I don't know what is!  #SuperBowl #SB52
He is the runner it is a touchdown!#SuperBowl
I repeat that I have no dog in this fight. But #AlMichaels sounds as if he has the @Patriots -5. #SuperBowl
And the best #superbowl commercial goes to Eli Manning and OBJ. 🏆 https://t.co/wsa8AoDwUw
"Some people may see your differences and may be threatened by them, but you are unstoppable. You will love who you want.

You can throw. You can run. Half that is null and void, because "What's a catch?" #SuperBowl #ShitShow
🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈 If you could pick any QB for this situation, needing a Touchdown drive in the Super Bowl, who would you choose... oh Tom Brady! Smh
I typically agree with Chris Collinsworth. I’m calling BS on this one. Should not be overturned. #SuperBowl
If you are watching the #SuperBowl, you have no right to complain that “baseball is slow”. https://t.co/Da9bOS91uE
At least two steps after he had control #SuperBowl
I swear to God, im not even watching the Super Bowl anymore if thats not a freaking TD.

The Super Bowl was Jack’s favorite day. The Pearson children are talking about how they’re reflecting on their father’s death. #ThisIsUs
Nick Foles was cut. 

He thought about quitting. 

He became a back-up quarterback. 

He worked hard. 

He got an opportunity. 

He took advantage of his opportunity. 

He’s now a Super Bowl Champion and Super Bowl MVP. 

The lesson? Never give up.
Or find a world of brotherhood in a new hobby opened up to them by a fully capable vehicle.

I have a feeling no one will look at the #SuperBowl the same after this episode of #ThisIsUs
@TMobile Great Super Bowl! Thank you for standing up for a diverse America!
I told the boys during fantasy season that the eagles were going to the super bowl and now they’re taking me seriously for picks next season 😎
I’m glad the eagles didn’t whoop my Vikings just to lose in the super bowl. I’m bout to turn up with my eagles fans tonight in mpls 😩😂 Vikings taking it all next year though 😂
The Nfc east now has 13 SuperBowl wins. Tf lol
Doug Pederson is THE coach of the Year!  @Eagles are Super Bowl Champions!  @NFoles_9 is MVP! 
Nothing else matters
@QUANMEDELLIN Aye we lost by 5 to the Super Bowl Champs 🤷🏽‍♂️

@LesBowen The only thing that is loose is Chris Collinsworth's grip on reality! He's still butthurt that he got bitch-slapped in his only Super Bowl shot. #FlyEaglesFly
Just balled out on eagles super bowl champ gear 🏆🦅💍
The Cubs won the World Series in 2016, the Astros won their first World Series in 2017, and now the Eagles won their first Super Bowl in 2018. Please let this be the year that FSU Baseball finally wins the College World Series!
Is it really an upset if you win in the Super Bowl? 🧐 both amazing teams..

All the games that I cursed at the tv and felt like shit after a gut wrenching loss.. it was all worth it cause we’re fuckin Super Bowl champs!!
If only 8 yr old me saw the Dinosaur Jeep Super Bowl commercial &amp;the Jurassic World commercial then I never would’ve given up on my dream go be a Dino hunter.
Even though I don’t watch the NFL, I’m from PA so I gotta congratulate the Philadelphia Eagles for winning the Super Bowl!!!🏈
Soooooo happy!! 😂

With PHILLY EAGLES winning The 2018 Super Bowl, guess the menu for Valentine's Day will be PHILLY Cheese Steak...LOL..  :-) What am I saying - I don't even watch sports..:-) But still, for whatever it's worth, Congratulations to the winners  :-) 37deg must feel like 87 in Philly.
Randall and the Super Bowl Shuffle are 😂😂😂😂🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽 #ThisIsUs
Watching Tom Brady lose the Super Bowl was extremely satisfying. #SuperBowl

I’m not a bandwagon Eagle fan at all. I’m a Phins fan and they’ll never make it to the super bowl 😅😭 but I’ve always consistently hated the Pats so 🤷🏻‍♀️
Now that the Super Bowl is over, everyone is about to watch Cloverfield.
What a game. Great game was played by both teams. EAGLES ARE SUPERBOWL CHAMPS!!! #eagles… https://t.co/o02HxI0Qq9
@Screamales did I hear the guitar intro to triumph during the Super Bowl tonight????
Philadelphia Eagles win the Superbowl go Philadelphia. Finally in my lifetime.
"The Philadelphia @Eagles are Super Bowl champions."

THAT WILL NEVER EVER, EVER GET OLD
Sucks to lose a super bowl when your QB throws for 500 yards and you don’t punt all game.
@Eagles Super Bowl champions https://t.co/c9eXf1wDgU
...if this was a movie... #SuperBowl @Eagles lol #FlyEaglesFly https://t.co/cezkWJeNnM
@logan_yamaoka I can't be mad about. They can't win every super bowl
One coach and two players interviewed as winners of the super bowl, all three give honor and glory to their "Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ"

How awesome is that!
.@RealSkipBayless once said on First Take that @NFoles_9 would be “the answer to a trivia question someone would get wrong some day.” They may get it wrong, but the question will be, “who was the MVP of Super Bowl LII?”

Sounds like it was a great year to skip the Super Bowl.
I hear media heartthrob Tom Baby lost and Justin Timberlake (I thought he was a British soccer star, sorry) bombed out at halftime, trying to act like some male singer who liked pink and purple, wore lipstick and leggings. https://t.co/BRYObqHZ0I
Now that we are done with the Super Bowl, we can get on with the wonderful February.... CARS on the track!!! Yusssssssssss
The only thing that could make a Patriots Super Bowl loss better is Tom announcing his retirement
KUTZTOWN IS ALIVE! I love this town, I love Philadelphia, I love today! THE EAGLES ARE SUPERBOWL CHAMPIONS! 🦅💚 FUCKING FLY EAGLES
Honestly I’m just happy the Steelers don’t have to share most Super Bowl wins with the Patriots.

I can’t believe it... we are actually super bowl champions !!!!!
I went to a friends place for their Super Bowl party only to realize that they don’t watch @NBCThisisUs and I was expected to leave after the the completion of the game. Guess I’m waking up early tomorrow to catch it on @hulu
Randall is listening to the Superbowl Shuffle. How did such a dork snag someone as incredible as Beth?
Love him tho
I'll say this: I am VERY tired of seeing the Brady/Belichick Patriots in the Super Bowl, but 7 of their 8 games are easily in the top 20, maybe top 15. And the only average one (XXXIX) was a 3 pt game. If they gotta go every year, at least they make it interesting #SuperBowlLII
Congratulations to fellow @Arsenal fan @JayTrain on your @SuperBowl win!
Not the biggest thing, but that lateral on the last kickoff was a mistake for the Pats. You want to waste zero time getting the ball to Brady there. #SuperBowl
In case you missed my hot takes on today’s Super Bowl in the @billingsgazette 5 on 5, I’d say I did a pretty good job in predicting its outcome and MVP...

https://t.co/ZBoVANILHe
Randall don't watch any sports but the Superbowl? #ThisIsUs
I was in the 5th grade when the Eagles lost to the Patriots in the Super Bowl. I thought that if that team couldn’t get over the hump, I’m not sure they ever would. Here we are, 13 years later. Same teams, different outcome #FlyEaglesFly

Monday out of office: Eagles won the Super Bowl. You know what it is.
Seeing progressives on twitter fall for meme that the Super Bowl is somehow a referendum on Trump is a reminder that dumb ideas don’t have a monopoly on one side

@dgoins As a native Dallasite and now recent Houstonian, it is - without a doubt - watching the Eagles win a Super Bowl. But it was better than the alternative.
That was a good super bowl

I will never know why Belichick benched the man that gave him Super Bowl XLIX..... hopefully Malcolm Butler takes his talents elsewhere.
Did anyone else think it was weird that the entire crowd on the field around #JustinTimberlake At the #SuperBowl half time show was all paid staff?  Is that how it is every year?
The Eagles won the Super Bowl and I’m an Eagle Scout, so I think I won the Super Bowl.

Can't thank these guys enough for all the work they do for @SabinoFootball1 ! What a great Superbowl Sunday https://t.co/Re2s6KkrKa
Now I see why Telladelphia, Snitchlevania didn’t wanna host their own Super Bowl.....
#repost… https://t.co/VkzeaxTfri
Between the Patriots losing the Super Bowl and that episode of This Is Us....I am emotionally compromised
Teams really should consider Super Bowl legacy prestige jerseys and defending champion jerseys like If the Eagles went chrome helmets all next season until they lost or something it’d be lit
when u post on the snap how fucking dumb the super bowl is &amp; the white boys w PF memberships who never go get TICKED off. https://t.co/gswb673447
@queen_3dith @LARRAYOX I was out all day man I missed the super bowl and the announcement smh
Dancin in the streets is great, your team has finally won a #SuperBowl. Just don’t mak the leap from fun to stupid knuckleheaded dumb stuff. https://t.co/hOJhUhXLrE
World. Champions. No one will ever take that away from us. The Philadelphia Eagles won the Super Bowl.
Did Al Michaels say that “another super bowl ended on the last play”. Don’t they all?? #SuperBowlSunday #NBCSports #PHIvsNE
I don’t think anyone noticed but during the Super Bowl, Freeform played Disney’s 1937 Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs on loop...just why? It literally played for over 4hrs.
Congratulations to @Eagles for #SuperBowl #SUPERBOWLCHAMPS great win, great game. Enjoy the victory.!
@ThisIsUsWriters props for having FOOTAGE FROM TONIGHTS SUPERBOWL IN THE EPISODE!!!! #ThisIsUs
@Dan_Fogelman how? It was showing the interception that just happened today in the tv in the background when Kate and Toby were dancing. The Patriots and Eagles have never played in the Superbowl before.

So cool the #SuperBowl shots shown on #ThisIsUs were from the actual #SuperBowl2018.
So...I heard the Sports team won.  Apparently they threw the sports ball further than the other sports team which in turn scored them sports points. #SuperBowl https://t.co/yzsa3XeZXI
fav part of the super bowl was when i called my dad to see his reaction and he says “my apple watch keeps yelling at me bc my heart rate is too high” OK DAD
Sorry if my tweet about philly made it seem like i cared about the super bowl at all https://t.co/j7XbR6upGh

I wanted to be thinner for when my SO gets home. So the universe gave me the stomach flu on Super Bowl Sunday. 10/10 for efficacy, 100/10 for misery.

Congrats to the Philadelphia Eagles for winning the Super Bowl. And to that security guard at the podium denying Kevin Hart from going on stage, thank you for the laughs👏 #KevinHart #SuperBowl
There's gonna be a bunch of Superbowl babies being made tonight
@brithume God bless Nick Foles who overcame so much adversity to become a Super Bowl MVP. It’s a miracle.
My old roomie and I might be doing the nerdiest thing ever: streaming newscasts in Philly while talking on the phone to see how they are covering their #SuperBowl win.
You and your mom a hoe if you make a 7 hr homework assignment due on Super Bowl Sunday smh
No sex for #Brady but Foles gets a whole year of it #SuperBowl https://t.co/8brQZ48PZQ
Phili won the super bowl... now free meek.
Coming home literally makes me so happy. Spent time with my best friend, bestie in law and beautiful god daughters and then got drunk w my family for the super bowl ❤️
So, with Nick Foles getting a Super Bowl ring tonight, that means Jeff Fisher gets one too, because you know, he made him the QB he is today.
I respect Agholor so much... eagles fans wanted him to be cut (me included) and the dude bounces back and catches passes in the Super Bowl... big passes in the SUPERBOWL... to help the eagles get their first Trophy... #FlyEaglesFly https://t.co/VY0I4W0JJd
Congrats @Eagles fans. Damn good team. @Patriots proud of you guys! You've given us fans so much. #SuperBowl
Super Bowl next year in Atlanta.... if the falcons go to the super bowl.... literally the stadium would be reserved for falcon fans only
Watching @KevinHart4real whine at post game security like a drunk sorority girl yelling at a bouncer was the best part of the #SuperBowl

The fact that #TomBrady did not congratulate @NickFoles_9 says a lot of his character... #jerk #beaman #SuperBowl

In the past, I’ve been very critical of Super Bowl LII MVP Nick Foles. Holy balls was I wrong. #NICK!
The story of SB 52? Tom Brady dropped a pass &amp; Nick Foles caught a TD.
Nick Foles was cut, thought about quitting, became a back-up quarterback, worked hard and got an opportunity. He took advantage of it, won a Super Bowl &amp; was chosen Super Bowl MVP. The lesson? Never give up.
I can't comment on Philly fans after the Super Bowl because God knows if the Jags ever win a ring, Duval will go full Duval, probably for weeks.

@PatrickLecter @MichaelDavSmith That was talked about that way a lot, too. “Wow! A great Super Bowl.”

XXX and XXXI were noted at the time for being kind of competitive, and that was the bar in those days for a good Super Bowl. Over the past 20 years since, they wouldn’t even register.
What the hell is a super bowl
@MiloVentimiglia I agree with your one word answer on how to describe the Super Bowl episode of @NBCThisisUs 🤣 f*&amp;%€# I couldn’t have said it better

ATLiens would like an urban Super Bowl performance next year in the city. We’re requesting Migos, Gucci, Outkast &amp; T.I. 😁

Thank you kindly.

Sincerely everyone from the South. Lol
The Eagles won a super bowl... all crime is legal for 24hrs 🙄 https://t.co/DpdJdOlCG7

@saraursum @pitbull @SuperBowl please please make my dreams come true
Philly bout half as lit as buffalo would be post Super Bowl win..
@ShannonSharpe Shannon. You are fanfastic! I will always be thankful for mentoring Ray Lewis and helping the Ravens win a Super Bowl. But why is Tom Brady so hated? About everything. He wasn’t blessed with athletic gifts. The man works. Hard. So many seem to literally hate him. I don’t get it.
#Eagles #SuperBowl 👋👋👋👋👆👆🙏🙏 https://t.co/HH746VH0Bo
Honestly the biggest loss tonight goes to the New York Giants, who can no longer say Eli is the only QB capable of beating Brady in the Super Bowl.
Took a nap through the super bowl now I’m wide awake lol
@PkmnMasterHolly I'm so happy Philadelphia won the Super Bowl I'm glad that they beat the God damn Patriots let the Philadelphia Eagles Fly High with a brand new Vince Lombardi Trophy go Philadelphia Eagles let them fly high with there wings spread open
@flaggmark1 Facts bro shoulda been the Super Bowl this year but it will happen 💯
Not for nothing.  But a week from Thursday I'm gonna find a race track and drive a car in reverse real fast! #SuperBowl #StevenTyler #ThisIs40

@Patriots played a great game hurts me to say this but eagles deserve that super bowl championship they played better and executed better than the patriot did!! I will be a pats fan till I die Brady’s still the goat and nothin will change that!! #PatsNation #Patriots #GOAT

Can we just not have another Super Bowl like ever? @NFoles_9 and the @Eagles put on a historic performance to cap off such a beautiful Cinderella story. I don’t want to ever watch another Super Bowl. Let’s all ride off into the sunset on this one. #FlyEaglesFly #SBLII

Anybody else find it funny how if the Patriots won the super bowl Brady would’ve gotten all the glory, but the fact that he fumbled the ball and everyone is blaming just the defense?
@budlight dies this mean you'll keep your word to the Eagles for free beer if they won the super bowl?

The eagles won the gosh darn super bowl!
Unbelievable feeling that the @Eagles have  won the super bowl. I remember TO, McNabb, and Westbrook playing during our last run. I had faith in Foles the entire time. Fly eagles fly  🦅
By the way I looked this up: The Dallas Cowboys most recently won the Super Bowl in 1996. That franchise is a disgrace. Eat it Jerry.

Quarterbacks with 3 Super Bowl losses:

Tom Brady

(Jim Kelly has 4).
off-season keys to @HoustonTexans winning Super Bowl 53..

• re-sign Joseph
• sign @Mac_BZ in FA
• trade for @Earl_Thomas 
• draft @Chico_Hndrxx 
• sign Nate Solder in FA
• find a reliable backup QB (whether it's thru the draft or FA - i.e., Bradford)

BOOM! champs.
The Cloverfield Paradox was such a fun post-Super Bowl @netflix surprise! I really like that the Cloverfield movies play in different spaces/genres without taking “connections” too seriously.

So a QB just won the Super Bowl and was the MVP running a college offense with a former HS Head Coach calling the plays 
But Lamar Jackson isn’t a NFL QB 
Seems to me many are scared to adapt to the talent 
Evolve or Die in this game
Seems obvious that Brady can't beat the NFC East in the super bowl
I should’ve went to work today but fuck that #SuperBowl was amazing plus I get to drink a lil😏 and play with my duo @CanadianDreamer .

@ejmilanio Late Super Bowl party? Lol 👀
@ejmilanio Fuck we totally should have had a super bowl party
Best super bowl since 2012 when the pats lost to the giants.
@RJinVegas Texans appear to be the best value here.  To take a team preseason to win the Superbowl for less than 8-10/1 doesn't seem worth it IMO.  Your thoughts @RJinVegas @DannySheridan1
I’m a great daughter I hope my parents know that. 

Literally just cleaned up all of the super bowl mess so when they wake up tomorrow for work they wake up to a nice clean downstairs.
Literally just watched the first 30 seconds of this is us super bowl and I'm already crying nevermind I'll watch it in the morning
Saw an ad for @Quaker. Couldn’t help but think, man! What a missed opportunity to do something Super Bowl-related! (“Your team” won!) By contrast, @Duracell did something https://t.co/orxHtneJ0s https://t.co/Aih4CXcmS5

Sorry Philly but you completely ruined this Super Bowl win especially for the good fans who don't trash their city and burn it to the ground.

It’s always the day of the super bowl i come to the realization about a situation. 😂🤷🏽‍♂️
I didn’t really care who won this Super Bowl, but I lowkey wanted the patriots to win only so Cibola can receive their 3rd gold Super Bowl football...😬
I have one final thing to say: NO ONE CAN EVER LOOK DOWN UPON AN EAGLES FAN BECAUSE THEY'VE NEVER WON A SUPER BOWL, NEVER!!!!!!
Actually eating horse shit after your squad wins the super bowl is fucking cool. Saying otherwise is an insult to Devine, among others https://t.co/8O4fN4FJek

@cnni Google says that the Eagles won the Super Bowl in 1960. Does CNN ever check their facts before reporting them? And I thought your organization only lied about POTUS. The Eagles were the only team to ever beat Vince Lombardi!
Remember when the Eagles not winning a Super Bowl jokes were going around...good times
Final #SuperBowl thought: There are a hell of a lot of people who know squat about football, the Patriots and  Brady, yet insist on spouting off about all 3. If I see another "Brady is racist" tweet I'm going to break my phone. I didn't mind losing but that's  beyond infuriating.

Man, talk about loyalty to your Head Coach. Matt is probably 24 hours from being named HC of the #Lions and could have easily thrown B.B. under the bus here by saying it was his decision and his fuck up. Patricia is a loyal man. #SuperBowl #SBLII #Patriots #Eagles #SB52 https://t.co/UeNLuFeyQc

broad street after the super bowl win is a lawless place, cops don't care. You could prob murder someone n say "fuck tom Brady" just to have em " go birds" you
@Patriots @madfisherman I've seen comments of people blaming Brady for the loss because of his age, &amp; I can't help but laugh. He had over 500 yds passing &amp; one of his best Super Bowl games on record. The blame is on the defense who had no answer, maybe with a new DC this defense can get a fresh start

Philly fans eating horse shit because they win the super bowl. Yet another form of natural selection
8. Doug Pederson’s success solidifies the value of having an offensive-minded HC. It’s his second season &amp; he’s already a Super Bowl champion. I think other teams who haven’t already done so will take risks on young offensive minds. It’s already a trend, but it’ll continue.
But most importantly, the Chiefs beat both the Patriots &amp; Eagles soundly in weeks 1 &amp; 2. Yet they were bounced out in the 1st round by an underwhelming Titans team in a collapse at home. Alex Smith can’t be the reason when Foles just won a Super Bowl. It’s a collective effort.
6. It will be interesting to see what this does to Carson Wentz’ legacy. He’s a Super Bowl champion &amp; he gave them home-field advantage throughout. But Foles won them the actual SB. Wentz will have to win one of his own for his legacy to be fulfilled as an elite QB of his era.
4. Non-elite quarterbacks have won Super Bowls before, but this was basically the first time in the no-huddle/increased-offense era that a non-franchise QB won a Super Bowl. Even though Wentz got them to the 1-seed, I think it’s clear that it’s possible to win w/o a franchise QB.
3. I wouldn’t be surprised to see Nick Foles be a starting QB on a team next year. He’s proven that he can lead a team to a Super Bowl. He’s been fantastic for a backup, &amp; not just tonight. I’m not sure there are 30 active QBs who would have performed better than he did.
Not to take anything away from Foles, but Brady had the better night. That was quite possibly Brady’s best overall Super Bowl performance. The only 2 “mistakes” that come to mind are the dropped pass &amp; the fumble. The pass was too high &amp; the fumble was a result of poor blocking.
Maybe they thought he wasn’t healthy enough. If so, don’t suit him up. He had a uniform on &amp; was ready to go. He’s a former Super Bowl hero &amp; has been a huge contributor to 2 titles. Even if that doesn’t matter, he is a focal point of that defense. Play him some downs.
I decided to make a thread of my final thoughts on tonights Super Bowl for anyone who is interested in reading. Here are my 10 takeaways from tonight:
With this latest Superbowl loss Tom Brady joins yet another elite,albeit more notorious  class. Only three other QBs have lost more than 2 Superbowl games. Fran Tarketon(3),John Elway(3) and Jim Kelly(4).
Cuando empezamos el viaje, cachando huevo del Super Bowl dije: voy por los eagles 🦅  -porque me Philadelphia , así de perkin- alguien me dijo “pero cata, los patriots han ganado como 20 veces esta weá” y bueno po. GoEagles.

This was a weird week. I left right after getting into a blow out w someone I care about/I got the job in Florida/I came home to news of my friend being shot and killed/The eagles won the super bowl/ Rollercoaster.

@Eagles And here’s some speech the NFL can’t suppress (outside of deleting this tweet). I dedicate the Super Bowl to the memory of Philando Castile. #NFLblackout
In all seriousness, about 11 years ago I watched a movie called Invincible and it got me to start watching the Eagles. I’ve wanted a Super Bowl win for 11 years and we finally got it. I love the Eagles, and they’ve given me one of my fondest memories. #FlyEaglesFly
I am a MN Vikes fan. I’m also DET Lions fan (long story). I’d NEVER pull for Chicago or GB if they went to the Super Bowl, so all these Dallas “fans” who were cheering for Philly? Yeah, y’all are die hards. Sorry not sorry.

Potentially long NFL/SuperBowl thread you didn’t ask for: I honestly don’t care one way or another that Philly won. I always like for the underdogs to win, so I’m cool with that. But, Philly fans are some of the worst (rude, loud, obnoxious, etc.) fans I’ve ever been around.
As a diehard eagles fan, there’s no one I cared more about watching an Eagles Super Bowl than Merrill Reese. https://t.co/NB1kQB1OCp
Nobody in the football world knows why one of our best players didn't play a single snap. Nigga played probably 95% of all snaps in every game and in the fucking Super Bowl he's suddenly not good enough to play? Something don't sound right.
It amazes me how you just one your first Super Bowl ever, and you respond to that buy destroying the town? Geez I’m happy for the team but always and forever will Eagles fans be trash
Glad I got to celebrate the eagles Super Bowl victory in the streets of Philadelphia and also smoking a blunt on the patco 😎
@Eagles I am so glad that anybody but Tom Brady’s team won the Super Bowl! I am also glad that I made it through the whole NFL season without watching an entire game. The NFL will need to do better to get my support in the future #nflblackout

“Rising very early before dawn, he left and went off to a deserted place, where he prayed.” (Mk 1:35) Many of us could do the same after the #SuperBowl weekend? We could use some quietness, prayer, and recollection to put sport, life, faith, family, work, career in perspectives.

we were absolutely slammed with take out orders today because i work at bdubz and superbowl lol, but i literally stopped in the middle of the restaurant and lowkey cried watching the new @JurassicWorld trailer
@FSNGorg @SuperBowl But Philly fans shouldn’t be. They’re destroying Philly
@djrothkopf I like Collinsworth- he reminds me of Super Bowl XXIII, the one where Cincy went ahead w/2:45 left, and Disneyland was asking Boomer Esiason what he was doing after the game, then Joe Montana saw John Candy in the stands and drove 93 yards for the win-  https://t.co/DbovMyKqVf
If the Lions ever win a Super Bowl my work will have to find a replacement for me for at least a week. 😂
OK.. I’m done for tonight. FLY. EAGLES. FLY. SUPER BOWL CHAMPS. DONT FORGET IT.
It's crazy that people are really hating on Brandin cooks. Y'all can't be happy that one of our own made it to the super bowl? Stockton has a lot of hate in its heart. That's sad

@AnshulKaria @NFLUK @SuperBowl @JayTrain 😂😂😂 it’s the Idris Elba effect. British men win in the states with that alone.
I can't even imagine what it fees like for a player to lose a game like the #SuperBowl 😕 I can't sleep - and I'm just a damn fan.
Let's be honest, Philly was gonna be a shitshow no matter how the Super Bowl ended. #PhillyRiots
I can’t even with this country sometimes. You win the super bowl and what do you do? Oh yeah let’s destroy our city and walk around chanting hateful shit that sounds great!

@carlreiner I enjoyed watching this Super Bowl (and its outcome) and I don’t even like football all that much.  This was a great game - both teams struggled hard to win but in the end the Eagles prevailed.  Congratulations, Eagles!

I just saw @IssaRae @SterlingKBrown and @TiffanyHaddish all together in one place at the #SuperBowl! How in God’s name did the world not combust

It comes down to what this event was. Was it worth not playing him in the Super Bowl? It's really not fair to talk negatively about Belichick until the story comes out. Emotions were high after the game. Tough to evaluate everything on an even keel.

Super Bowl announcers terrible missed Cory clement dragging his foot#
Here's what I've come to gather on Malcolm Butler.

It's likely all contract related. They didn't get a deal done, brought in Gilmore instead. Butler has been subpar this year. Frustration probably boiled over between him and Bill. Before you know it he's sitting out Super Bowl.

@Vicki_TG Gotta think positive. If the Eagles can beat the Patriots in the Super Bowl, then we can turn the skins around next season.
For inquiring minds, I've now thoroughly enjoyed one Super Bowl in my lifetime. It happened Sunday. Good luck to your team in the draft.
I’ll take my Joe Montana memories and be content with those four Super Bowl performances. Steve Young is icing on the cake. https://t.co/QpQceC4NcN

I’m still waiting for a Rodgers vs Brady super bowl 😭😭😭
I understand that the Super Bowl is one of the best forums for advertising but.....how many people are in the condition to remember the ads. The game ended about 3 hours ago and I can’t remember even saying goodbye to people earlier #justsaying #SuperBowl2018
Two things happened today, #Eagles  won the #SuperBowl and I saw my first bad episode of @cyborgturkey. The Elmo skit was the only redeeming thing about it.
For that 99 year old man Eagles fan in the crowd, I'm so happy your team won! I know if I was 99 sitting at the Superbowl and my Giants won....I would be ecstatic!! I would be happy just being able to be at the Superbowl, win or lose! I'm not an Eagles fan but tonight wings flew
Another night of catching the highlights and superbowl commercials after work. I don't mind it at all.the future will make up for it comfortably.
@DRmetwatch @OBJ_3 #EliManning that #SuperBowlCommercial was hysterically funny 😄 even though the @Giants had a disappointing season they still know how to have fun. #NYGiants #GiantsPride. Only team in @NFL history to beat the @Patriots twice in the #SuperBowl 2007 &amp; 2011 #NewYorkGiants

Tom Brady almost pulled out a super bowl win without his top two receivers. Not an excuse to lose a game, but still damn impressive. I’m proud of Tom. Proud of the season Tom Brady had. I’m a proud fan.

This was the worst patriots team in quite some time and they didn't have to play any great teams to make the super bowl. Injuries really took away from what looked like a very strong roster going into the season.

I keep thinking of Viking fans. You get beer cans thrown at you in Philly. Get pantsed in NFC title game there, then watch that same fanbase fly into your house, they party for for a week while you host, they win Super Bowl, and wreck your place like a rock band on the way out.

@SioSana1 @BostonGlobe They didn’t dominate Brady. He broke his own passing yard record that he set on last years super bowl with 505 yds and also threw for 3TDs the only reason patriots didn’t win was because their defense didn’t show up. Go to the point and reflect how bad your team is
@CsweeneyArtist Nah - would have been a fool to bet. With 5 SB trophies in 16 years (and one of them against the Eagles) we know you can't win them all. Congrats to your Eagles on their first-ever Super Bowl win. Enjoy it while you can 😉 https://t.co/sXWjux0aPi

@KaraSewellTV I think most Cowboys fan are happy the NFC won I would much rather see a NFC team win the Super Bowl than an AFC team win. Cowboys are a NFC team
Sounds amazing in any language - SuperBowl Champions!!! #FlyEaglesFly #SBLII #PhillyPhilly https://t.co/B9IBaBvi6l
https://t.co/ThxSzfaV73 your PR got one job to get you on stage
Yo. The Eagles finally won a fucking SuperBowl. Surreal.
Seeing my family and friends tomorrow at our traditional super bowl party was awesome 💕 https://t.co/PDPttZS6CR
I can see why Philly never won the Super Bowl I guess it'll be another 40 years before they win it again after all of this..#MoreMeltDowns https://t.co/7T3VykE6FM https://t.co/7T3VykE6FM
I did not watch the Super Bowl. Instead, I watched the entire Orange series and was all up in my feelings. Such a touching portrayal of depression and friendship. 😭
Congrats to Berkeley’s Nelson Agholor on the Super Bowl win for the Eagles! @BPS_Football @nelsonagholor https://t.co/GJe1LooWO5
@RealSkipBayless Up yours Skippy! Your jealous and can’t take the fact the Eagles are Super Bowl Champions.
@PatrioticCindy Did boycott Super Bowl! From now on! Even pre season game.
Congratulations to all my Eagles fan friends. It was a great game - a real nail biter. Foles had an exceptional game. He was spot on as was the whole team. They looked like the Pats usually do (that is a compliment 😉). Enjoy the parade!  @SuperBowl
So hyped that Philly won the Super Bowl!! https://t.co/SmogBJ2NGS
Shark Week begins with America Monday!! 🇺🇸
Wear your red, white, and blue today.  

As a bonus, all Eagles jerseys count in respect for the Super Bowl LII Champions! 
Sorry Pats fans, your jerseys only count because the colors match.

Heres a PR anniversary you have to celebrate: 11 years ago, 9 months pregnant. The post-Superbowl Monday weigh in topped charts at 200lbs!!! Two months post delivery, when the dust settled, a cool 180lbs 😳😱🤪. #50poundslighter11yearsolder  #riseandgrind #20chai
@NASHFM947NY @camjones1977 I think @kennychesney would be a great halftime preformed for Super Bowl LIII!
I actually had friends text me and tell me not to leave my apartment last night because of the super bowl
Damn... I wish I would have put $100 on the Eagles to win the Super Bowl before the season started, and had Eagles 1 Pats 3 in the $100 block pool..
OH WAITTT, that right I FUCKING DID!!!

What I learned from the Super Bowl? Miracles can happen...hint hint @AtlantaFalcons 👍🏾 😉.

Had the time of my life and won a pretty penny gambling today. It was at a locals' bar in rural Hawaii. I don't normally put cash on events like this, but when I see two 4-year olds fist-fighting, I need a piece of that action. Super Bowl was cool too.
I can’t contain my excitement today. Still basking in the Philly win and all these sad Tom Brady memes. #sadbrady #SuperBowl

I did not watch the Super Bowl but I am glad the Eagles one and I’m not even a Philadelphia fan of any of their sports except the 76ers back when Dr. Jay and Moses Malone were playing
At least I’ll get to watch the Pats in Atlanta for next year’s Super Bowl
On another note, waking up to a Patriots Super Bowl loss is a great way to start the week.
I don’t know why the day after the Super Bowl isn’t a holiday yet.

Takeaways from the Super Bowl:
1. 1200 yards is ridiculous. 
2. Nick Foles is from Texas. 
3. Justin Timberlake was wearing my shoes from 9th grade and I want them back damnit.
4. If I never see a shirt or suit like JT was wearing ever again I’ll be fine. Wtf

I can’t believe how good that super bowl was; best ever and I’ve seen them all since VII and the ones before that were dubbed Super Bores...@KenCarman GD is Foles Nice AF.
@MPetersonWx Welcome and congrats on your team winning the Super Bowl
Big ups to @CityMinneapolis for putting together a great @SuperBowl  cities could take a lesson from the lightrail use and security lines

A quick summary for all my ‘I-clearly-don’t-watch-the-SuperBowl fans out there: Patriots fans are shook and that means lots of petty remarks will be made throughout the day. #SBLII
@975Mornings I had a dream last night that we won the Super Bowl.  Oh wait......
Good Morning did you know that @Patriots loss the super bowl? Ok so dont worry, be happy! 😂😂
@foxandfriends  why dont they just have the Super Bowl on Sat night? Bc that makes too much sense?
I don’t even really watch football nor did I watch the Super Bowl, but I am soooo glad the patriots lost!!🙌🏽😂😂😂😂
I thought it was just me that couldn’t hear the #superbowl halftime right. https://t.co/1JDqwW3ecT via @nypost
But on the real, I enjoyed my night, good company &amp; good vibes, &amp; we spent our first Superbowl together as Eagles &amp; Patriots fans 😌🙌
Hats Off to MSP! I was very concerned about traveling for work today due to all the Super Bowl travelers. BigWin for TSA and MSP
@lindythackston Hi Lindy. I hope you have a great day and looking wonderful today. Outstanding Super Bowl and sending prayers to Edwin Jackson’s family after what happened to him. Very sad.
Literally cried to the Eagles fight song on the radio and this is why the Monday after the Super Bowl should be a holiday.

Rewatching the NBC Broadcast. The Eagles really put a kibosh on Michaels and Collinsworth dreams of a Patriots super bowl. They sound like really unhappy assholes. Fuck em!!!! Eagles SB champions https://t.co/gd3N7uYhYo
All Eastern Time-Zone schools should be on a mandatory 2-hr delay the day after the Super Bowl. While I’m at it, add the World Series games to that list.
If the Eagles can win the Super Bowl then 76er’s in 5 2019

The super bowl was exciting but now let’s turn our attention to the two on one date on #thebachelor tonight
Steelers win a Super Bowl: hey neat, good job guys 
Eagles win a Super Bowl: FUUUUCK YEAAAAA! AMERICAAAA!!! TWO HOUR DELAY FOR EVERYONE!!!  

As for me, I’m back to bed. 😏 Two hour delays as an adult are magical
Love waking up and remembering we won the Super Bowl. Hate waking up and seeing that we celebrated by literally tearing apart the city. 😒
My favorite part about the Super Bowl is that now when Brady fans say he’s the goat, I can agree. #SuperBowl2018

Doug Pederson just outcoached the greatest coach ever in the super bowl...I guess he's not coach of the year
To those waking up to the headline that Foles outplayed Brady, please take a step back and realize that couldn’t be further from the truth... With just 3 healthy WRs, #TB12 threw for 505 yds &amp; 3 TDS... It was one of the greatest performances in #SuperBowl history. We just lost.

🏈Why are the Eagles 🦅 Super Bowl Champs❓ Face it: Their QB was just a better receiver than the other QB‼️🏈
The Super Bowl commercials weren't bad. A few great ones for sure. That said, after several years in a row, we can safely say there's no more watching the SB just for the commercials. Those days are gone. It's just not the same.
Good morning everyone. Also, congratulations to the 2018 #SuperBowl Champions @Eagles and their fans.#FlyEaglesFly
Good morning the Eagles are the 2018 Super Bowl champions and I will be saying that every morning for the rest of my life
My hot take since i won’t be on the show today.

Tom Brady WILL NOT win another Super Bowl.

Have a great day.
#FlyEagelsFly
@foxandfriends super bowl halftime show not good!
Boiiii, I’ve never been happier to be wrong! We’re Super Bowl Fucking Champions!!! Ahhhhhhh!!!! 🦅🦅🦅 https://t.co/D6ceBNzlJy
@RickeySmiley did you see @KevinHart4real at the#superbowl? https://t.co/kC8XIkaLDQ
The Eagles beat the Patriots because their play calling was relentless. The Jaguars lost to them because theirs was not. #coaching #superbowl #andtherefs
Cool y’all won the super bowl but I better not hear “sixers” and “finals” in the same sentence
@foxandfriends #SAGUAROSAM. WHAT THE HELL IS “ RACIAL PORNOGRAPHY ?” WHY IS PRES TRUMP ON ESPN???
Viewers should read about 15 Medal of Honor Winners introduced before Super Bowl Coin Toss and understand why every military person,regardless of rank, must salute MOH winners. https://t.co/QjTwFdHoPv
Continuing theme of Pats v. Bird Mascot team, I’m predicting Pats/Cardinals for next Super Bowl.
#ha 🤔😊
Superbowl really posses me off last night.. Atlanta is a better team than both the Eagles and Patriots.. They better get they shit together next year bruh
And I almost forgot: One of the #Iowa stars of the #AlbertTheBull #SuperBowl ad, Clint Curtis, told a funny tale on stage last year for our Des Moines #Storytellers Project. https://t.co/Ppau57ogP1
@FoxNews @Eagles What a bunch of idiots! Win the Super Bowl and destroy your city? Wow! Grow up! #NoPrideOfYourOwnCity
#FlyEaglesFly @SuperBowl 
#SBLII Champions!! @CurleyPrincipal https://t.co/osqM5nMfQd
@joerexrode He never won a Superbowl himself, so he's man crushing on Brady. He should never be allowed to do color at another Patriot Superbowl. It was sickening. God help us if the Bengals get back to the Superbowl and he's doing color. 😒
Keep it classy Philly.  You can do better!  It’s your first Super Bowl!! https://t.co/SyMOrZyTzQ
Errrbody keeps on talkin about a super bowl and how good it was and we might be wrong but we're pretty sure they are talkin about our #AcaiEnergyBowl again👍

Happy Monday :)

I’m still shaking from disbelief. This has gotta be the best year for me. Super Bowl win. New job position. Negativity away. Seeing all these artists in concert. #FlyEaglesFly
@ColtonFootball They cheated on at least 1 Super bowl.

Lost to the Giants who were 9-7.

Won 3 by a field goal.

Cheating always brings a cloud.
Also, I don’t know what Malcolm Butler did to not start or play on defense after seeing their secondary struggle all game but I hope it was worth sitting a former Super Bowl MVPer. #SuperBowlLII #Patriots
Another absolutely incredible Super Bowl w/ pure drama from start to finish. But the same two clouds over the NFL once again showed up &amp; had a huge impact. A star player lost due to a concussion &amp; 2 huge calls that swung the balance where we had no idea how to define a catch.
That was an amazing Super Bowl! Congratulations to the Philadelphia Eagles!  Super Bowl Champions! #FlyEaglesFly https://t.co/K2Pm4uOWUH
Why am I up. Im so hungover, my body hurts.. #SBLII #SuperBowl #FlyEaglesFly
When you wake up and remember the patriots lost in the super bowl last night 🙌🏻 #HowBoutThemEagles 🦅🏆
Had a scary moment last night after the game.
Only one up late at night, cleaning up on Super Bowl Sunday, no crockpot on but the dryer had baby clothes in it.

Thought-do I leave this on and go to bed?

Then thought of "Jack:.

Turned that SOB off.
PHL 🛫 YYZ. Thank you, #FlyEaglesFly ... that was fun! #Superbowl https://t.co/RGLIfjaE1C
What a rollercoaster of emotions  yesterday. My nephew @Jake_Cox8 breaks historic goal record in the NA3HL, the @Eagles won the Super Bowl, @jtimberlake phenomenal, @ThisIsUsWriters gave me closure, @jimmyfallon brought the night to a close with all my faves #emotionallyhungover
https://t.co/I0ZuOwdkry
Coach Belichick I respect you as a coach but what you did last night with that cornerback was dead wrong you should have handled that in the offseason let that man playing the Super Bowl that's why you lost
Chris Hollingsworth performance as commentator for SUPER Bowl was an embarrassment to NFL sports fans.
He was materially biased in favor of New England (wrote off the Eagles at the end of the 3rd Q) and lauded Timberlake performance; like comparing chicken poop to chicken salad.
@FoxNews @Eagles SALUTE!☺

Congratulations!🌹

SUPERBOWL!☺

CHAMPIONS!☺

Philadelphia! Eagles!☺

💗
My favorite part of the Super Bowl was having to go into work at halftime. 🕺🏼
The eagles are finally Super Bowl champions https://t.co/5OVg8UqtRe
Happy #VictoryMonday everyone. We awake this morning as Super Bowl champions in the most Philly tale of a championship of all time. 

#FlyEaglesFly I'm now finally ready to move forwards in my life now that this weight is gone. #GoBirds #Faith
my brother won $1600 off the superbowl &amp; was lot asf .. 😂 like .. nigga $1600 is chump change to you 🙄.
@foxandfriends    Agree with Brian.  I didn’t like the half time show at the super bowl. Boring!  Seen better #SuperBowlHalftimeShow

@GlobeChadFinn The Super Bowl not the time to prove a point i will get you later Stupid
I'll be on @cheddar around 9:40ET today with a final analysis of #SuperBowl commercials.
Think about this Georgia Sports fans the falcons were one well played called drive away from beating the team that one the Super Bowl 🙁
The best part about #SuperBowlLII is the Pats are still tied, not ahead of the Cowboys in the Super Bowl count. I’m counting on Big D to tie the Steelers for most Super Bowls with their sixth next year!
Hoping everyone had an excellent Super Bowl Sunday. Ladies, look on the bright side- a new This… https://t.co/tcgmH0EhBp

I just wanna give a shoutout to @cj_wentz you are the MVP of that SuperBowl big dog ✊🏾
Worst Super Bowl commercial? For me it was the T-Mobile diversity ad. The message was fine I guess, but it felt like pandering.
Adulting is coming in today after the super bowl and way too many festivities even though your work offered for you to be on call, but you needed to make your monies.
So who else is having a Super Bowl baby in 9 months? 🙋🏼‍♀️👶🏼
Listen on to The Nine right now as we talk about all things, Super Bowl on 92.1 WPTS radio!

@tweetlessrist Sko birds.. super bowl champs baby
I can’t believe it’s been 10 years since I saw the giants win their first super bowl. I was only 12 then didn’t understand how rare it was to win a title at the time.
@KevinHart4real should host the post Super Bowl game for now on...just saying! #SuperBowl #football #KevinHart
Congratulations Philadelphia. Only you can go from the happiness of a Superbowl win to the downfall and stupidity of rioting and tearing your city apart
Howie Roseman faces one of the most difficult decisions a NFL GM has had to make.

Yes, Chris Breezy would have killed the SuperBowl halftime performance. SB 52 was so boring. I guess they do not want the best.🔥
@imcorinnemec Her: lots of yelling going on over here (super bowl)

You: you at the monkey cages at the zoo?

where is the "out of context" part of what u said. Just so I can understand. 😑
Good morning, the Eagles won the super bowl
@crosstrainer81 @ShannonSharpe 5 super bowl man - they have won 5 Super Bowls. That’s like calling the United States military crappy because they didn’t win Vietnam - forgetting they kicked ass in WWI and WWII.
I'm a Nick Foles fan and was thoroughly impressed by him this postseason but Philly fans are crazy if they think the Eagles should keep him and trade Carson Wentz (I've seen a few people tweet this). Anyone can get hot and play well for a month. #SuperBowl
White mediocrity is letting a 37-year old white guy play the super bowl halftime show for the third time.
It was a good Super Bowl to watch this year! I’m gonna miss football.

I’m pretty sure Kylie’s pregnancy announcement should have been at least top 5 on the USA Today Ad Meter. It dropped as new content on Super Bowl Sunday, was what everyone was talking about pre game, and is the #1 trending video on YouTube. https://t.co/1aHlJ7QJ6Y https://t.co/rWUjfVqROS

@michaelstrahan I know your mama is going to whack you one good time! LOL @GMA #SuperBowl
😂😂😂 @getnickwright gave Justin Timberlake an F grade for his Super Bowl performance
Doug Pederson ate Bill Belichick alive and Nick Foles came out on top against Tom Brady. And the Eagles won the Super Bowl
Hooper, NE.....home of the best Olympic Medalist volleyball player in the world, a Super Bowl Champion Head strength coach and the best Belmont Stakes handicapper in the nation. We're a different breed.
Philly really deserved that super bowl! Should be even better next year with Wentz, but if you are Foles you need to go somewhere else!!
@cnni One of the best Super Bowl  halftime shows.
Eagles won the super bowl. Y’all have a great day!
Only dawgs can beat the patriots in the Super Bowl son . Same way the giants defense was
i didn’t watch a minute of the super bowl yesterday &amp; somehow i feel stronger, more powerful. 💪🏻

I’m up by 8 in the super bowl of life. Good morning.
@JClarkNBCS Mr. Johnson, you are the arrogant one. You ran your mouth, we dont. Lucky for you, our defense was awful. However, you are the one who is arrogant. You won one Super bowl and already talking shit.

The NFL really should be thankful for Philly this year. Hosted one of the best drafts ever and displayed a fantastically exciting Super Bowl. 74 points and 1151 yards between the two teams. #FlyEaglesFly

@TylerJordan23 @GoodAdviceGraf It is possible to be a chiefs fan, root for the Chiefs, hope and pray they make the super bowl one day, and when they get knocked out in the WC or Divisional round, root for the best QB that's ever played.
@Bighugh53. You should thank the FALCONS FOR GIVING YOU THE SUPER BOWL TROPHY
@SocialPowerOne1 I know it made my Super Bowl experience better!!
Yes I did. I just rewatched last years #SuperBowl halftime show &amp; the energy, passion, intensity, love, personality, choreography, dancing, vocals, customization and EVERYTHING were above and beyond. THAT was something special that we got &amp; damn @ladygaga, who will ever top that! https://t.co/t0f8ffYshC
Wow! @MissouriLottery we loved your commercial during the Superbowl.
Juuuuust a touch salty the Falcons didn’t make it this year but at least Lull was spot on with her prediction! #SuperBowl https://t.co/bEQLGeK2YD
It’s the day after the Super Bowl, all of philly has burned down and the Mob is moving in towards D.C. Nick Foles has ascended. Armageddon is upon us. We all thought it would be the North Koreans that would kill us but no. It’s Eagles fans

If you’re a Pats fan celebrating 2nd place today, you should have your fandom revoked. The great thing about cheering for a team like them, or the Steelers is we get to count championships. Anything less is a lost season. #SuperBowl
@LeipoldNFL @OptimaFantasy Thats correct, which is why it didnt come to fruition. However, given the fact that those 2 missed kicks are such a rarity for those teams &amp; that it happened in the #SuperBowl, thats still pretty damn impressive. @Acr8athletics &amp; co have been doing #analytics for a long time.
@NFL @Eagles @SuperBowl V.O.C is super excited!!😦😄 with the E.A.G.L.E.S winning the Superbowl. It was a great team effort.

Dodge’s exploitative Super Bowl ad took the substance of Dr. King’s speech – which warned against excessive materialism – and turned it inside out to advance its brand.

And to all you Patriots fans &amp; Tom Brady fans, take that sad look off y'all faces 😂😂 you do know y'all are favored to win next year's Super Bowl, right? HOWEVER, THE UNBELIEVABLE RUN your team been on &amp; your guy has been on for 18 years has come to a end I believe.
The road to Super Bowl 53 starts now. Let’s draft some studs, find a great owner/owner group, and let Turner set up some new plays on offense. #KeepPounding

On past, when Pats lost Super Bowl, I was devastated. Today, not so much. Probably cause I am grateful and happy for the five they have won and getting older I realize it really doesn’t change my life today......#TB12GOAT

Friendly reminder: it’s okay to riot if your city’s team wins the super bowl... but that’s it.. no other time
Why does winning the #SuperBowl automatically cue burning down your city?
My neighbor was really feeling the Eagles last night... Like it wasn't 10 degrees out... I love Americans.  #SuperBowl #FlyEaglesFly #TweetLikeThe2000s https://t.co/8zsEtPZFqn

This is the Kansas City Chiefs QB Len Dawson in the hours before what would later be known as Super Bowl I.
Can you imagine Foles or Brady puffing away on a Marlboro before the game yesterday?

@bills4th @VFBaller @Dollarjunior75 @DJ81 @sack_master101 @wkemp15 Btw 5 &gt; 1 huh it's funny how you say that now after the super bowl.. our ONE is the current one.. against your team. So enjoy the off-season.
That’s funny, I’m pretty sure Aaron Rodgers has never thrown for over 500 yards and three touchdowns with no picks and lost. Not to mention it was in the Super Bowl, not a wildcard or divisional round game. https://t.co/0ygczSGsq6
not gonna lie im a little disappointed the pats lost taking away our superbowl parade

My main takeaway from the Super Bowl is how fucking tired I am of people-famous or not-lip syncing and/or rap battling. Goddamn.

this superbowl was the woat in terms of the ads. 
they really used an MLK speech where he specifically spoke against people buying cars they couldn't afford, where he literally name drops Chrysler (Dodge's parent company), to sell Dodge trucks
Two great things have happened:
1. The patriots lost the Super Bowl/The Steelers still have the most Super Bowls 
2. The people of Philadelphia are literally destroying their own city 

This was a win win for the people of Pittsburgh

@msenicaracing @SuperBowl @NFL Same Officiating Crew followed the Pats all the way to the Super Bowl.. 👍🏻

Can we all just agree that Philly should never host a Super Bowl?! #trashcity #trashypeople
I just watched an ad to watch a super bowl ad on YouTube.
@Forbes @jtimberlake 🔥lit up the #SuperBowl I was wondering why they were playing 🏈 @jtimberlake concert 🤔
@geoff_calkins @JWright929espn I throw up in my mouth hearing the Eagles are Super Bowl champs.
Dont waist your time or our time Mr. President!  More important things to think about! They (NFL) don't even deserve an invitation!

Best part of being a marketing major on Super Bowl Monday is discussing all the ads. Worst part is that I'm in college and don't have cable so didn't actually see any of them..lol
What’s getting lost in all this is last night was the first time a #Patriots #SuperBowl was decided by 7 or more points #FlyEaglesFly
This should help with the #SuperBowl blues. Happy Monday!

@LawsonsFinest https://t.co/6Qt1dVTnzy
All that disappointment, all the trash talk, all these hate, all the disbelief. You all can take a fucking seat. And stay there. Super Bowl Champs! 🦅😉😍
Honestly man I know you can’t call a whole super bowl on one play but like I will go to my grave believe that Zach Ertz touchdown was not a touchdown and that what costed us the Super Bowl
A team blew a 28-3 lead in the Super Bowl, wait, it was them, so they did do that even before the won one https://t.co/65bYNKrYOJ
@NFL @SuperBowl And that is all it is. Give it your best and if it falls short on to the next one. Proud of my Pats!!
@bills4th @VFBaller @Dollarjunior75 @DJ81 @sack_master101 @wkemp15 That's not even factoring in that I also told you that pats fans now since you won that super bowl in 01 forgot what it felt like to never truly go back over and over or contend every single year. Eagles had to endure a hell of a lot longer than the pats had. With the no ring bs.
This is exactly the right attitude to take to any profession. Never look at the scoreboard. Focus on the task at hand.
https://t.co/hYAjJ3QlVk
Malcolm Butler been playing like trash so the Patriots bench him &amp; now every Patriot fan thinks he was the lost prophesy in that Super Bowl lol fuck outta here
I almost didn’t watch the game but it ultimately turned out to be a great game..On paper the legend against a back up who almost retired..back in the league and Super Bowl MVP..What a story..Underdog prevailed which is the thing you love about sports ..on any given day. #txhsfb
Rioting in your city after your own team wins the @SuperBowl is like @BenSPLATT breaking his actual arm after winning @TheTonyAwards for @DearEvanHansen. It just doesn’t make sense.

Never understood the whole, “Our city just won the Super Bowl, let’s destroy it in celebration!” thing. How about maybe sprinkle glitter everywhere instead? Little less invasive, but still catostrophic during cleanup.
I know I just threw a Superbowl party but can I have people over again for the opening ceremony??

what is the meaning of “MVP”? the player that has the most significant impact on the performance of their team? if we all agree to that meaning of “MVP”, how was the super bowl MVP not Tom Brady?? over 500 passing yards, 3 TD’s and a 115 passer rating...lemme know?

I’m sure Wentz is truly happy for Foles and to have a SB ring but after everything he did in the regular season  there has to be a part of him thinking, “this was my Super Bowl to win.” How can there not be? The NFL is so unpredictable- no guarantee he’ll ever make it there again

The Philadelphia Eagles *team* won the Super Bowl ... Not you. Not the media guys. Not the homer WIP radio guys. Stop saying "we" and "us". You don't play for the Eagles. Enjoy the win, of course. But please stop thinking that you had anything to do with it.

Off the soap box.
I boycotted the NFL and did not watch the Super Bowl. I just watched fox this morning and they said not one player kneeled during the national anthem. I guess President Trump asked them not to. Thank you President Trump

How does a backup quarter back start in the Super Bowl away from home in the Minnesota Vikings Metrodome? How will they emerge victorious through the confetti, destroying all the nightmares involving mom’s spaghetti.
Last night, I didn't watch the Super Bowl. It was tough because I spent my whole childhood playing Madden but I have to stick with my principles.
The worst part of a Pats SuperBowl loss for me is the barrage of drunk midnight texts from everyone I’ve ever dated (mourners and gloaters alike).
The fact that my English professor openly told us that he is hungover from the super bowl. I feel ya man I’m still hungover from Saturday. https://t.co/J12RakSFlx

A lot of Tom Brady slander after he put up amazing numbers in the Super Bowl. Surely not the reason why they lost, if you can literally only get one stop in the game it will be pretty hard to win. Brady put record numbers up, no interceptions. Dam near flawless quarterback play.

@deniseneil That would make sense. Cause super Bowl performers don’t get paid. They just do it for the promotional value.

#Eagles fans out here bragging that they’re the only ones to stop Brady &amp; the #Patriots in the #SuperBowl. FYI, the #Giants did it not once, but twice before you guys. Congrats, you won a SB, but don’t be saying you’re the 1st to beat the Pats. Giants started the trend! 🏈
I made a promise to myself pending on the Superbowl results and because the Eagles won, I can FINALLY do it. I'm about to film my own Nick Foles 30 for 30. Anyone wants to help out please let me know. #FlyEaglesFly

Nick Foles was cut. 

He thought about quitting. 

He became a back-up quarterback. 

He worked hard. 

He got an opportunity. 

He took advantage of his opportunity. 

He’s now a Super Bowl Champion and Super Bowl MVP. 

The lesson? Never give up.

@TwoThrice @netflix Cloverfield. It’s like the third installation he’s made of the movie but they bought out a slot in the super bowl for the ad so you know it’s gonna do numbers.
@TeawithTolkien I starting watching the Super Bowl without knowing who was singing, so I was pleasantly surprised.
I think the fact that I got through TSA and got Starbucks at MSP on the day after the Super Bowl in under 20 minutes is impressive. I literally waited at Starbucks longer than at TSA 😳

Thoughts after attending Super Bowl 52: I think I can safely say I never want to hear that “fly eagles fly” song ever again, seeing a halftime show live is unreal, and Tom Brady is still the GOAT.
In my entire life I never imagined the eagles winning the Superbowl would feel this good. I can't even describe the feelings of seeing Philadelphia fans worldwide enjoy this accomplishment
The best of super bowl!! Loved this!💓💓 https://t.co/xivxQlKE2t

@jszmuc Man I used to buy a jersey every year in the preseason. I had Thomas Jones, Rex Grossman, Lance Briggs, Peanut Tillman. I also had Muhsin because I bought a Super Bowl Jersey which was on sale and I had to commemorate the worst day of my life.
Plenty of people disliked the MLK / Dodge Superbowl ad. Don't forget that it was approved by the King estate. His kids / estate wanted the money.
In a belated tweet, I am so happy for the #PhiladelphiaEagles and all their fans for winning their very first #SuperBowl. #Philly joins an elite group of cities for winning professional sports championships. When the San Jose Sharks win a title , the Bay Area will join in! 😆

The Patriots vs. Anybody in the Superbowl is a microcosm of the US Presidential election cycle.
There are only two choices, neither of which represents me in the LEAST, but hey, we GOTTA choose one, so then it devolves from actual support to "just choose the lesser of two evils."

Not playing Butler in the Super Bowl was a discrete/ subconscious form of angst (hidden resentment) or passive -aggressive  agitation-inviting conflict with Kraft- as Belichik looks to use his astounding leverage to position himself for ownership stake in a franchise.

Go big or go home I guess. But wouldn’t be my celebration tool after a Super Bowl party. https://t.co/hplpo3V5NP
Best part of being super bowl champs? I don't have to hear any lame ass rings jokes! 🖤🦅💚

@AnikoTevvit It's a sort of series of 3 JJ Abrams movies. The first 2 wre pretty good. This one was a "surprise" release directly to Netflix and announced on the Super Bowl. From reports, it's OK.
@NatalieEgenolf This is Super Bowl LII
@stephenasmith If the reports are true that he violated team rules the night before the Super Bowl, he deserved to be benched. He put himself above the team and paid dearly for it.
If fate is going to let the wild animals of Philadelphia win a Super Bowl, then this has to be Northeastern‘s year to win the Beanpot, right?
Congrats to the Philadelphia Eagles (I B A fan🦅) finally getting that #52 Vince Lombardi Trophy 🦅🦅 feels good being in the Super Bowl Convo 😉
@brywegter @APSE_sportmedia @gazettextra @Eagles @Patriots @Bucks I see what you did there with the Super Bowl headline. 👏👏
i can't believe the eagles won the super bowl and they still have yet to play anybody good
Best Super Bowl commercial: Dirty Dancing with Manning and Beckham. #IHadTheTimeOfMyLife
if people would only get as excited about fixing things like world hunger and human trafficking as they are about the Eagles winning the super bowl.
wake up.
@TomiLahren Bashing these “guys” for taking a knee. Demonizing them, making them out to be unpatriotic was petty. But oh well. Why would they want to hang out with a guy who disparaged them for months? No, I’m proud they will stand up to the man child tyrant. #TheyEarnedTheRight #Super bowl
Why do fans riot after a win? The science behind Philadelphia's Super Bowl chaos. 🏈 https://t.co/EetYhq8n6e
I think there should be no work after the super bowl and the 4th of July... as much as people want to be responsible most of America is going to celebrate both of these events!
Last year, 54 million women watched the Super Bowl, 49% of the total audience. (39 million women watched in 2009, ~40% of total) As viewership declines it's women who are the growth opportunity. But you'd never know it from the ads.  https://t.co/pX57e7WLMJ
"@SadderDre: The Eagles sacrificed Meek Mill to win the Super Bowl. The Falcons gotta sacrifice Quavo next season" Yea, they can have him..
If Outkast and Gucci Mane don’t do the Super Bowl halftime next year,  Atlanta shall be burnt down for the third time.
Yesterday was highly excited moment about the Super Bowl LII that Eagles defeated Patriots with their efforts.

Congratulations, but to all the Eagles fans need to go home and rest, instead of going outside and vandalizing things at the streets.
Does it still count as the Madden curse if Brady lost the Superbowl instead of getting injured? 🤔
@ReneeYoungWWE It was so basic and plain and not super bowl worthy . Leave the SB to the pop girls if this is how Its gonna be
the best part about our super bowl party was when the infinity war trailer came on and there was two guys and i stood up and were screaming about how excited we were

Alabama is the best football program in the country and it’s not close at the moment. There’s no shame saying one of their own didn’t play a major role in the Super Bowl.
@willcain Patriots hater here. Idc what the petty reason is, there is NO reason to bench your key CB the day of the Super Bowl. If Butler fucked up bad sit him out for a qtr &amp; fine him heavily after the season is over. The stakes are too high to send a msg Super Bowl Sunday.

My two cents on Super Bowl. Many are characterizing the Brady strip-fumble as the key play of the game. For me, Foles 4th down TD conversion in the first half, and even bigger, his 4th down conversion on the winning drive w/4 minutes left were the standouts.

@corbydavidson NFL should do Super Bowl on Saturday for international audiences
The NFL already won when the Pats were handed a super bowl ticket by the refs. So it doesn’t hurt that Brady lost. But that was the best refereed game I’ve seen in a while.

Plus Tom's already got 1 more superbowl then them. You're argument would make more sense if Bradshaw and Montana were both 5-0 and Brady was 5-3, but would still be illogical. People try to do this to LeBron 'hes lost 5 finals' like its better to not even make it to the finals.
My favorite Super Bowl commercial! https://t.co/zLhBjDsBp5
@GottliebShow Maybe a better comparison is Steve Young helping the 49ers get to the playoffs in ‘88 &amp; ‘89 when Montana would get hurt. Young is technically a 3-time super bowl winning QB even though he only started the one

No catches in the super bowl we’re controversial.
Was this Super Bowl in the top 5 of all time? It was thrilling with a lot of scoring. And had most yards ever in a game and came down to the last play.
Damn they are slamming the fuck out of that Superbowl halftime performance lol I didnt think it was that bad but then again I was pretty fucked up at that point and I passed out in the bathroom last night lol
How else are you supposed to spend the day after the super bowl other than watching all of the oceans trilogy

@Pink just wanted to let you know that I cried when you sang at the superbowl you were truly amazing one of the best   Thank you

Let's recap today -

Called Democrats traitors for not clapping at his State of Union speech

Took credit that nobody took a knee at Superbowl

Bragged that he is "non-braggadocious"

Seriously though, still seeing Twitter, Instagram and Facebook posts from 17 hours ago, 2-3 days ago talking about the #SuperBowl. Platforms need to rethink their algorithms and understand what’s time sensitive and what’s not.
Usual after the super bowl conversation at wrk is about all the commercials. Today? No, today was all about the whining @CollinsworthPFF did the ENTIRE game. He even continued AFTER the game.  Shut up already!

@hotfunkytown Good, but they will cash the checks from all that work on the Super Bowl plantation,
We saw Flacco and Eli (2xs). You just saw Nick Foles win the super bowl over Brady. Case Keenum and Blake Bortles make it to conference championships. And you still think Miami should focus on QB first. I hate you all

The last time Janet Jackson saw the Top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 was 2001 (not counting the "We Are The World" thing 😂). Justin Timberlake has had 19 Top 10 hits since then. Maybe that's why she hasn't performed another Superbowl and Justin has? 🤔
Everyone’s talking about the Super Bowl today. Why don’t we talk about last night’s episode of @NBCThisisUs? #WATERFALLS. Pretty sure my tears could have filled a quarry. Also, the storyline was just phenomenal. #stillcrying

Ya know, I woke up today and guess who were the super bowl champions... THE PHILADELPHIA EAGLES💪🏽🦅 PHILLY VS EVERYBODY🤞🏽
My two cents on Super Bowl. Many are characterizing the Brady strip-fumble as the key play of the game. For me, Foles 4th down TD conversion in the first half, and even bigger, his 4th down conversion on the winning drive w/4 minutes left were the standouts.
Was that doctor Oz in a Superbowl commercial https://t.co/90Q5kwL6kv

@danielleinzano I’m honestly happy that the eagles won the Super Bowl despite them beating the Vikings (my favorite NFL team), there’s no entertainment in watching the same teams win it every year, takes the entertainment out of watching sports!
People look at me like I'm dumb for being interested on wrestling and I'm looling at them as trash as they pull down streetlights because their team lost the superbowl.

@chrissyteigen SB football LII. I'm a pro I worked the super bowl yesterday and volunteered for it last week.
Congrats to the Philadelphia Eagles for their Super Bowl victory last night.  I’m a PATS fan always and will be.  We will be back next year!
So many conservatives claimed to boycott the NFL, but what were the Superbowl ratings this year.
@nflnetwork is replaying the Super Bowl right now. And not going to lie, I am watching it. @Eagles #FlyEaglesFly #SuperBowlChamps2018 #eaglesnation #wedidit #stillinshock
Last night I was rioting next to this guy that said “where the bitches at? I’m tryna put a baby in someone just to say my kid was made on the day the Eagles won the super bowl” 

I laughed, he didn’t. He was dead ass.
I still cannot believe what just happened last night. My Philadelphia Eagles,  ran out of the tunnel to dreams a nightmares, played one of the best games I’ve ever watched, and beat the best QB of all time to win their first ever Super Bowl......WOAH. #FlyEaglesFly
@JimmyKimmelLive @JayTrain @CoreyClement_6 The day my #Dolphins traded you I freaked. I said " watch him win the #SuperBowl " Happy for ya @JayTrain
@jesss__caaa Congratulations finally joining the super bowl club 😉
Give the Super Bowl halftime show to Foo Fighters.
@MatthewColler After all the ticky tacky calls all season long they decide to “let them play” in the Super Bowl. That last one just blows my mind. It’s also strange to me that there’s little to no discussion about the lack of calls, particularly that PI
@Eagles Super Bowl replay now on @nflnetwork   Oh my.

The day after the #SuperBowl, #minwk18 begins. @fhunscripted’s sermon title, based on Ephesians 3:14, is “I’m taking a knee.” Rev. Dr. Haynes has taken a knee for justice in many ways. May it be said of us, too. #tbtg
My final thoughts on the super bowl (for now)...
'Best of U.S.' NBC Olympics Super Bowl commercial: Nathan Chen https://t.co/w1ee3EsANW
@BriztolJeff At the time he was a backup. So was Roethlisberger the year Tommy Maddox got hurt. Same with AJ Feely the year McNabb and Detmer got hurt. Brady won the super bowl after starting the season as a backup. We don't know Carson Wentz will come back. What if Foles becomes the starter?
What I heard about Malcolm Butler: Early week he was sick with flu, missed flight. When he arrived he was already behind. So #Patriots relegated him to ‘Nickel’ (fewer plays, less strength) to protect him. He WAS expected to play Nickel #SuperBowl 1/2
Good for them. Although,  he won't invite them knowing they won't come. POTUS preemptively insults.

In 03, the Patriots went 14-2 and went on to win the Super Bowl, and guess who won of their two losses came to: the Redskins. BRING THAT ASS
I don’t have a problem with Brady not shaking hands after the Super Bowl. I DO have a problem with the fact that everyone disrespected Cam when he didn’t accept the loss the way THEY thought he should
@cruisegirl56 you’re wrong linda... nick foles has 0 super bowl losses, that is much less than brady.

Most underrated thing from the Super Bowl last night was that it ended before 10 PM CST. Pay close attention @MLB how that was done.

It’s was cool to see Minnesota host #SuperBowlLll over the last week!  It’s even better to see that it was so well received so hopefully this means they get another Super Bowl in the future!!  #nfl #BoldNorth #SuperBowl52
I wouldn’t wish the @NBCThisisUs Super Bowl episode on my worst enemy
Crazy that Alshon could’ve won Super Bowl MVP if Stephon hadn’t balled so hard in the 2nd half. Those are some special #Gamecocks.
The fact that Kylie Jenner Trended more than the Super Bowl this weekend is actually disgusting. What is wrong with people nowadays 🤦🏻‍♂️🤢🤮
I voted for #JTCrushedIt on @TheTylt—I agree Timberlake gave an epic #SuperBowl performance https://t.co/OstFJelNh8 https://t.co/2eECI0ikbU

🤔 Chip Kelly is the head coach of UCLA, Donald Trump is the POTUS, the Philadelphia Eagles are Super Bowl champions and high school students are eating Tide pods . . . am I awake or is this all a strange dream/nightmare (🦅 🏆👌).
Tom Brady : 5 time super bowl champ on 8 appearances, 4 time super bowl MVP, 3 time NFL MVP, member of the all 2000's decade team 

Antonio Brown: a really good reciever

@BetteMidler I hope they ask her to come back and she flat-out right said absolutely not! She is too good for a halftime Superbowl show!
Do I think playing Butler would have helped the #Patriots ? Yes. Do I think they lost the #SuperBowl because they didn't? No, there were many other factors that played into that.

I never thought I would see the Eagles win the Super Bowl Yesterday was Everything I dream of.
So, since they won in our stadium that’s our Super Bowl, right?
Bar in Denver is replaying the Super Bowl. Oddly I’m still nervous watching the game.

@Nick_Loder Philly parade, Thursday. So you can experience a Super Bowl parade at least once in your lifetime😘
@TomiLahren Look these guys will be missing a huge opportunity to talk with the President and put their concerns on the table. Come this time next year thumbing your nose at an invitation won’t play in their favor Super Bowl LIII. Jus sayin’
Tom brady has basically everything a football player can ever dream of having but doesnt have the decency to congratulate a backup quarterback after winning the first super bowl in eagles franchise history. Real role model right there.
I believe the Philadelphia Eagles winning a Super Bowl is greater than a child being born.... no one can change my mind!
They should have asked Tom Brady whether he would accept the results of the game. I honestly thought he was better than this.

@JordannRuggles @Zachpiona @casgirl1818 lmao i swear everybody was talking about her more than the super bowl
Actually, this is incorrect. Saban won the championship in the 2003-04 season with LSU over Oklahoma and Belichick won with the Patriots in the 2004 Superbowl (2003 season) over the Carolina Panthers. https://t.co/uzYpf01rKc

12 NFL Teams without a Super Bowl Championship. 
ATL, Cincy, Buff, CLE, AZ, LAC, DET, CAR, HOU, Tenn, Minn, JAX

Who wins one 1st?
Point is after 5 super bowl Wins in a salary cap (parody induced) league I trust the Pats are playing the right players @ the right time..thus having won that much in this era. they lost Sunday becuz the other team outplayed them for 60 mins not becuz of 1 individual. No excuses
We DEFINITELY had nothing to do with this:
https://t.co/95py0NdirJ
Im not gonna lie I really thought there was gonna be a rematch of the Super Bowl tonight but it was just a dream 😥
The only Super Bowl content I want to read are stories that end in a gay leather bar.
I like the part in “The Two Bills” when Parcells and Belichick are looking at the Giants Super Bowl trophies and Belichick says “those are the two we won, and those are the two we [Patriots] gave up” lol
Hmmmmm... maybe it's time to switch to @TMobile. Also, when will trumpkinheads figure out that their numbers are too low for anyone to GAF what they #boycott.

The list could go on and on. I think our hypothetical fan who stopped watching after 1995 and who then watched last night's Super Bowl would be shocked be how different (and generally better) the game is now.
Skill position players who make impossible catches constantly that make Lynn Swann's Super Bowl X catches look routine. All positions - WRs, TEs, and RBs.
Let's say you watched football in the past but stopped after the 1995 season. Super Bowl 30 was your final game until you resumed yesterday. Here's what you will be pleasantly surprised to find after 22 years.
For all the hand wringing over the NFL these days, not without reason, the entertainment aspect of professional football was on full display yesterday in Super Bowl LII.

Same shit with Bron. It’s not better for your legacy to not get to the finals or super bowl less. The more you carry your team there (and they both do, annually) the better your legacy. Rings are not an individual accomplishment

Tom Brady GOAT.. y’all crazy if you don’t think so. Philly came out to play and out played NE. Philly was the hot team coming into the super bowl. Y’all needa STFU saying TB12 overrated/choke artist. His D was 💩💩💩💩💩💩💩
Shout out to @tide for this brilliant #SuperBowl ad. Prediction: significant spike in Tide sales. #TideAd https://t.co/SRehCducZy
What is this crazy rhetoric that it’s better to lose before the super bowl than in the super bowl? 

Brady is 5-3 in Super Bowls 

He’s been to EIGHT. 

“But Bradshaw/Montana are 4-0”

They’ve been to HALF the SBs Tom has and TB isn’t even done yet.
Bro Greg Ward Jr has a super bowl ring now.
@Pink @NFL  best way to make the next Super Bowl great is to have P!NK perform the half time show!  Talk about a great halftime show!  Amazing National Anthem and was sick!  Go see her show.  Can’t be topped!

Nobody will ever beat Michael Jackson’s Super Bowl halftime performance in 1993. And I wasn’t even born to see it live.
you know Brady’s the greatest when people are really saying “is not making a catch (!?!?!) to win a second superbowl in a row and 3rd in 4 years at age 40 a knock on Brady’s goat status?” like is 505-3-0 in his 8th (!!!) super bowl not enough? are you not entertained!😂 #GOAT
I don’t buy it.

Butler would not have been benched for the entire Super Bowl if he were only guilty of a “minor” curfew violation.

Even if Belichick felt that Rowe would match up better against the Eagles, he would have given Butler a shot when Rowe &amp; Gilmore were being lit up. https://t.co/E3xz26ekUq

Surprised? The Super Bowl is not just the annual event, but it is an important, a meaningful football game. What exactly happened this year? Tom Brady, not putting together the drive downfield et cetera? You know the real answer. It really is football. And football is life. https://t.co/FtVrYu9pvg

Nick Foles proved me wrong. I didn’t believe he could make it to the SuperBowl, let alone win it, but that’s exactly what he did. Proud of this former Ram and thankful that he didn’t give up when he was on the verge of it. https://t.co/kkKib7evIW
@LG_Blount Hey man I’m a Pats fan and am glad you were able to win another Super Bowl. Screw all that sore losers that can’t handle the fact that things happen and people change teams. Keep doing what your doing your a Hell of a player.

If eagles can get a top 5 pick for Foles I say we trade him but I still want Foles on the team because Wentz’s health is unknown. Foles has now had 2 historic seasons. 2013: 27-2 7 TDs in one game and a great game in the playoffs, 2018: 3 amazing playoff games and super bowl MVP
That was an amazing Super Bowl #SBLII

Y’all, this why I haven’t opened social media much since the super bowl... 💀😂😂😂 https://t.co/8jzB979pZg
Looks like the #GoBolts called in sick after the Super Bowl.
#NFL | El corredor LeGarrette Blount y el defensivo Chris Long (Eagles) se convirtieron en los primeros jugadores en la historia en ganar el Superbowl por dos temporadas consecutivas enfrentando a su exequipo. Ambos se habían consagrado campeones en el 2017 con Patriots.
#NFL | Desde 1989 no se fallaba una patada de punto extra en un Superbowl. Jake Elliot (Eagles) lo hizo primero. Luego lo hizo Gostkowski (Patriots). Por ende, el Super Bowl LII fue el primero en la historia en que ambos equipos fallan patadas de punto extra.
Cardio done. Now on to weights. Got to try to counter some of those bad Super Bowl Sunday food choices. 😏 #GymTime
#NFL | Los Patriots se convirtieron en el equipo perdedor del Super Bowl que más puntos anotó en el partido, superó a los 49ers (SB XLVII) y Dallas Cowboys (XIII) quienes hicieron 31 pts cada uno.
#NFL | Los 74 pts anotados en el SuperBowl LII son la 2a mayor cantidad en la historia del Super Domingo, uno menos que el triunfo de los 49ers de San Francisco ante los Chargers de San Diego (49-26) en el Super Bowl XXIX.
#NFL | Corey Clement se unió a Torry Holt (Super Bowl XXXIV) como los únicos novatos en sumar 100 yrds recibidas y una recepción de TD en la historia del Super Bowl. Clement es el 1er novato no reclutado en el Draft NFL en conseguirlo.

#NFL | James White (Patriots) anotó su  4o TD en un Super Bowl, empatado así la 3a mayor cantidad de todos los tiempos, detrás de los legendarios Jerry Rice (ocho) y Emmitt Smith (cinco). White está empatado con Roger Craig, John Elway, Franco Harris y Thurman Thomas.

I am torn on who stole the super bowl: the eagles winning, JT’s Wallpaper outfit, Will Smith’s Instagram or Kevin Hart’s rushing the field drunk to get on stage. I think @KevinHart4real wins this. Watch his snaps and instastory, 😂!! #IrresponsibleTour

@lindsayczarniak Do you think Alex Smith will get the Redskins to the Super Bowl?
@bnick48 @TheFalcoholic It’s time to be realistic. We legit choked away a 25 point lead in the SUPER BOWL. It is what it is at this point. The catch is if we can even make it back.
Good morning, quick reminder that God is the greatest and the Eagles are Superbowl champs! Have an amazing day😊

People giving Belichick grief for benching his best corner in the super bowl because it cost him ‘a championship.’

A championship represents 1 season.

It’s thinking like that that will prevent most people from building a dynasty. I’d trust him and learn from the decision.
Dam, if these guys who robbed gronks house his fans, they are no longer his fans to him. I just hope they didnt steal his superbowl rings. How sad would that be? Smh wow! #RobGronkowski #Patriots

If you win a super bowl you can go anywhere you want and relax. If you’re the MVP you are stuck in Disney for a week. 😀😀
@jabo1331 @TheHerd Well if the patriots played their best game then it comes down to coaching. Bill benching Malcom Butler is one reason but mostly if Bill gets credit for the super bowl wins he must be accountable for this Super Bowl loss. Did he out coach Andy Reid or Dan Quinn?

Two days later after the #SuperBowl it definitely still hurts. But then I realized that we had a lot of injuries to key names like Hightower and Edelman. QB Tom Brady despite the loss played his heart out throwing for over 500 yards. #Patriots #GoPats #TB12.

Nick Foles super bowl MVP "don't be afraid to fail". As parents we are so afraid of letting our kids fail that we can actually "rip away" the most valuable life-long attributes from our kids souls that have proven to be the difference makers to a successful happy productive life.
@MikeHawkeyeH send me all the charts ya want---the only numbers that matter to me is 106 million watched the Super Bowl and it was the 10th most watched TV Show of All time.

Nick Foles was cut. 

He thought about quitting. 

He became a back-up quarterback. 

He worked hard. 

He got an opportunity. 

He took advantage of his opportunity. 

He’s now a Super Bowl Champion and Super Bowl MVP. 

The lesson? Never give up.

@UnusedSubsPod @TampaBayRowdies @fccincinnati @IMGAcademy @Sudsanity Figured with @cincysoccertalk and @UnusedSubsPod that it would have the production like the Super Bowl half time.. where the stadium gets lit with the teams winning colors.. or who drinks the most after the game.
@TODAYshow This is an interesting way to teach your kids about losing. I don't think the Patriots intentionally shared winning a super bowl because they've won so many or let the Eagles win. There was no sharing or letting other people win. Both teams wanted to win.
@howardeskin @SuperBowl @SportsRadioWIP Did you get any more info on Brady not shaking Foles’s hand? Seems very Busch League. Would’ve been a big story if roles were reversed.

If Outkast doesn’t do the halftime performance at the super bowl in Atlanta next year, they failed us. Anything else is unacceptable.
As a @Vikings fan it hurts me that we did not make it to the #SuperBowl but it makes me happy to see a team like the @Eagles perservere and win THE game. "The big thing is don't be afraid to fail" Nick Foles

I will not congratulate any #eagles fans (tons of them all of a sudden) since they had nothing to do with the team's success. Also because none of them congratulated me when my beloved #Astros won the superbowl a few months back. Go eat some more horseshit and chill.

So if you thought PA was going to burn down bc of the super bowl you were wrong... if it burns down it's because  @jen_yaco just turned 21

@OfficialTyLaw Just an embarrassment. Not having Butler play reflects on bad coaching. Period. If you want to discipline him you do it after the Super Bowl but you don’t leave your stud corner out of the game, bad coaching.

The ignorance in this tweet is unbelievable. The Giants held a undefeated Patriots team to 14 points in Super Bowl 42 and 17 points in Super Bowl 46! How can you say nobody has done it? Super Bowl 46 ended with a Brady Hail Mary in the end zone to Gronk just like this one https://t.co/iDGcDqsFFU
If I find out any of my friends in Philly partook in any of that madness destroying the city after the super bowl, then I’m disowning them indefinitely.

@lmbartelt @Eagles @ImpolitePod the same comment wouldn’t be said if Clinton had won &amp; wasn’t said when Obama won (twice). I feel it’s the same argument-God controls the outcome of the Super Bowl unless it’s not the outcome you want-its circular logic to favor oneself AND ignores the power of free will.

Mr. Timberlake’s tribute to prince was very thoughtful. He paid tribute to Minnesota’s most amazing and talented person. I grew up with his music and his amazing talents.  But what do I know. I was just a worker at the Super Bowl that served food to the 2200 volunteers.

I'm still mad about that Superbowl bruh lol I think I'm more upset that Malcolm Butler did not play on defense
@aaapharmclub I couldn't not know about it watching the #Superbowl It was literally every other commerical

Griddle me this, griddle me that. 😉 Sometimes you just need to bust one or two out. I used them to make Philly cheese steaks for the Superbowl.

No, I am not over the super bowl win. We waiting a very long time for this one. BIRDS BIRDS BIRDSBIRDSBIRDS
.@TheWorldof_AJ was really moved by all the pre #SuperBowl media festivities. 😂
https://t.co/vrki1xZdDr
@Toucherandrich Just an embarrassment. Not having Butler play reflects on bad coaching. Period. If you want to discipline him you do it after the Super Bowl but you don’t leave your stud corner out of the game, bad coaching.
Peyton Manning threw for 141 yards and an INT and won a Super Bowl. 

Brady threw for 500+ and 3 TD’s and lost a Super Bowl. 

Brady fans have to finally accept that its impossible to give one player all the credit for titles in the ultimate team sport
@EliotShorrParks @AndyMills_NJ So...what would have happened if they didn’t win or even make it to the Super Bowl

Hey Philly, the Broncos will trade Trevor for Carson. I mean, they have the same amount as Super Bowl rings in as many starts 🤔

Never has there ever been a team more deserving of a Super Bowl championship than this year’s Philadelphia Eagles. Still trying to wrap my head around it..

Optimist Falcons fan: In their last 3 games Falcons D held the Panthers to 10pts in essentially a playoff game, 13 to the #1 O in NFL, and 15 pts to the team that put 38 on the #1 D in NFL, the 41 in the Super Bowl. We should be an elite d with a majority of weapons on o back

Somebody has to say “Super Bowl Fucking Champions” at the parade on Thursday. Have to continue what Chase Utley did no doubt about it.
1. Nick Foles is not a MSU man. He played 97.22% of his games at Arizona.
2. Tom Brady was 28/48 for 505 yards, 3 TD’s, 0 Int. Pats losing the super bowl doesn’t mean he isn’t the GOAT. Had one of the best Super Bowl performances ever. His D gave up 41. Still the goat.

It had the 52nd best outcome, though.

Hey @instagram I’m sick of seeing pictures of Tom Brady walking into the super bowl. Make it chronological again plz
I've seen a few people accuse Brady of dinking and dunking in the super bowl. Give me a break with that one. Foles and Brady both completed the same amount of passes yet Foles threw for 132 less yards.
Gronk has had a rough couple days, losing the Super Bowl and then going home to ya crib being robbed? Tough

@985TheSportsHub @MikeGiardi @Toucherandrich Just an embarrassment. Not having Butler play reflects on bad coaching. Period. If you want to discipline him you do it after the Super Bowl but you don’t leave your stud corner out of the game, bad coaching.
How do i even watch this Flyers game tonight, just put on the Superbowl replay @NBCSPhilly
I didn’t have nearly enough buffalo chicken dip as I wanted to on Super Bowl Sunday and honestly I’m sad

So I started a new route today at work, walk into the stop six Jps to pick up the money. This super old lady looked me right in the eye and said “come in here like this again and imma eat you like like a bowl of pig feet” so not only is today cancele,  but this job is too.
After closely analyzing rosters &amp; contracts. I concluded the Eagles will win the Super Bowl again next year, and will likely return to the Super Bowl again the following year. Now excuse me while I go find my McNabb jersey in my storage unit.

@SportsSturm @tseguinofficial Super Bowl thoughts? Hamhuis’s 1000 celebration?
The Patriots would’ve won The Super Bowl Sunday if Belichick hadn’t come down with amnesia.There’s no other explanation for him forgetting that only 3 years ago Malcolm Butler was the very reason he WON the damn Super Bowl. Curfew Schmurfew
@ReeseWilson94 @BM_Wark @FOXSports @RobParkerFS1 Ill give ya Moss thats a great point. But what did Welker do without having Manning or Brady? I think he benefitted from having 2 HOF QBs. Plus, TB won a Super Bowl without Gronk.
@mac_dope_feet @usnikefootball Enjoy it! Unfortunately It’s probably the last time you’ll see the eagles win  a super bowl in your life time
Still can't believe the Eagles won the Super Bowl. I have been replaying the Foles TD catch, the Ertz TD, and the Graham strip sack over and over and over in my mind for the past 36 hours and I get chills everytime. Best feeling ever
Is it me or we never get any air time on the national network? I swear every super bowl champ I couldn’t get a way from seeing them on the main networks. As soon as we the world champs I haven’t see them once since I been watching ESPN today. The Hate is real man. Philly vs 🌎
I love to hear a great explanation about why #MalcomButler was benched during the Super Bowl?

@_Pharod @Eagles We just won the super bowl man, we shouldn’t have to do much, I think Bradham/Burton should be our biggest priority. And obviously the draft, I think BPA because here isn’t a glaring hole on the team
@cj_wentz If it wasn't for you we wouldn't have even been there thank you you were just as much a part of the Super Bowl as Nick Foles!

@BuckCityBreaks I was in the UK &amp; watched the Super Bowl there. Ajayi was a commentator. I thought that was a huge mistake getting rid of him.

I’m gonna have to go back and rewatch the whole super bowl, doesn’t seem like Brady threw for 500 yards, I feel like they be padding his stats

I’m still upset that Trump tweeted about the winner of the Super Bowl so quickly but it took him HOURS to talk about a shooting. 
Especially after he said nobody should support the NFL.
@nikkihaley @jtimberlake Wait...you watched the Super Bowl? I thought you stood in solidarity with Trump and his supporters to never watch football again. I thought the NFL was un-American for not demanding their players to stand during our national anthem. Are you defying @POTUS ?

@OmarKelly @chrisperk Offense of line makes a lot of sense!. Just look how well the Eagles OL play in the super bowl. Pass catching TE is another must,maybe in the second or third round.
@benmaller@eddieonfox @DannyGradio Poor Pats' fans, they are suffering, my heart goes out to them. 🙏 https://t.co/sfExEqTbQu
Two days ago, I was on the sideline for the @Eagles' first-ever Super Bowl win.

Two and a half years ago, when I graduated from UMN w/ my Master's &amp; zero prospective jobs, I never could've imagined this would be my future.

Life has such a funny way of working itself out. https://t.co/LkEagDTIfz
@mrkevinwhite @Ky1eLong Man can you imagine a player wanting to give your team a Super Bowl and you shitting on that player? Y’all ain’t really fans! #BearDown @mrkevinwhite @Ky1eLong y’all know the real fans ready for you both to bring us to the promise land
@NBCSBoston @tomecurran Just an embarrassment. Not having Butler play reflects on bad coaching. Period. If you want to discipline him you do it after the Super Bowl but you don’t leave your stud corner out of the game, bad coaching.
Stupid people. Just because the #EaglesWin the #SuperBowl , doesn’t mean you have to do stupidity like being violent especially car over. Honestly people.. 🙄👎🏽🤦🏽‍♂️ https://t.co/wgK7ePB2Kf

All four NFC east teams have WON the super bowl since 1992. Don’t tell me it’s not the toughest division in football historically or as of now
To answer my own question, it was the patriots in 04 &amp; 05. Don’t be the dumbass that comments just to comment if you don’t know your facts. Oh &amp; the question was will the eagles win the Super Bowl next year... like I said HELL NO! https://t.co/Dvl31a7cw9

Super Bowl complete, thanks to all.
I thought if my dad the entire game and cried like a baby when we won. I had a picture of my dad watching Super Bowl XV hanging on my tv, he was with us during the game. https://t.co/C0bVj6ViVL
I'm proud to say that I watched more of the Space X #FalconHeavy launch than I did the #SuperBowl

@ShanderShow @RealMamaEagle Yeah cause when people said Nick Foles was still going to lead the Eagles to the Super Bowl after Wentz went down I really thought people were fantasizing. I gave him one playoff win off of good defense and that was it.

@undisputed @JoeMontana @49ers @RobParkerFS1 This CONTINUES to be the dumbest argument in the history of sports. WHY would you rather have a player lose EARLIER in the playoffs than in the SUPER BOWL?!?! If you are 4-7 in Super Bowls, it’s waaaay better than 4-0. It’s not hard to understand folks.
@tarikbazzy For sure for a normal win, wtf does a patriots championship mean to me? Absolutely nothing, I’m no Boston flukey. If that’s the case you’d trade a win for every Michigan alum’s Super Bowl victory? Wake up
@SirenMika As far as the Trump thing goes. The entirety of the Patriots organization pretty much distanced themselves from the guy once the issues cropped up. Called a spade a spade. Brady skipped the White House meeting after they won the Super Bowl last year.
In solidarity with Cardi B, America’s sweetheart, I will also not be performing in the super bowl halftime show until Kaepernick is back in the NFL

So. For some reason in all the videos I've seen it appears the vast majority of Philly rioters after the Super Bowl were white.

Dudes tipping over a car? White.

Dudes breaking down the Ritz Carlton awning? White.

Seems strange how "powerless" the police were...

Ok man I’ve been disrespected two times today because the Eagles won the Super Bowl and people quick to say were ignorant because of what hood were from. Pisses me off because all these mother fuckers is over me in rank in the military so I honestly can’t say shit the way I want.

So the only thing Malcolm Butler has admitted to is that he needs an attitude adjustment and that he took a late flight to Minneapolis. Claims the events of Saturday night before #SuperBowl were false. Missed no curfew, no substance, etc. #Patriots

Still not sure where this SB loss ranks in terms of worst losses in the BB/Brady era. However, I think it’s safe to say it will be no higher than third.

I will say this, I don’t think Malcolm Butler not playing lost the Patriots the super bowl. Eagles punted once and threw a pick, pats punted 0 times. Missed chances in the red zone. Score in the red zone you win. End of story.
@JohnDennisWEEI Belichick is known for making great halftime adjustments. This would have been the best, easiest adjustment to make: put in a pro bowl cornerback that is also a great tackler. No-brainer. #Patriots #SuperBowl #NFL

@RealMichaelKay you just asked Steve young if you saw any slippage in Brady after he just threw from 500 yards in the super bowl. Can’t even believe that’s a thought in your mind. Very sad.
@iamjohnpollock your recount of the super bowl was slightly inaccurate. The patriots were down 5 with over 2 min left (plus TO) so theoretically needed a touchdown to win before Brady’s fumble. You were however 100% spot on that Saved by the Bell reference. 😃 Iowa Zack 10 bucks.

Man, the absolute stone cold ice in your veins balls it takes to call your own number on fourth and goal in the super bowl. Love it.
I helped put the whole conspiracy together. It was me, George Soros and Kevin Hart. First, we went back in time and made Foles look awful in 2014-2015. Then, we set the point spreads. Finally, we greased the ball before Brady took the snap so he’d fumble away the Super Bowl. https://t.co/DMmE2U0LsW

@JimKaten @couch2five @DeuceClutch @AdamSchein @CBSSportsNet The AFC was a joke in the 80's.  The Super Bowl was the easiest playoff game for the NFC for about a 15 year stretch.  He should have gone 4-0 in the Super Bowl.

Bill Belichick sacrificed a super bowl ring to feed his ego. Do I want him gone? Absolutely not. He’s the greatest coach in all of sports history. But the truth is the truth, with Butler out there the team most likely wins on Sunday. BB lost this one for his team.

@prochaska_emily @MUS490590 The super bowl is unique because it’s not just a staple in our yearly entertainment, it’s a cultural event. The audience is roughly a third of the US population. That’s a HUGE audience to market to. For the performers as well as brands.
The @Lions having to announce Patricia as their HC after getting torched in the Super Bowl is the most Detroit thing I've ever seen.

The Bills snapped the longest playoff drought in all of pro sports
The Eagles won their first ever Super Bowl, and beat the Evil Empire to do it
Then McDaniels turns down the job everyone and their cousins thought he was gunna take since the position opened

With the Eagle win in the Super Bowl the Patriots makes be off their high horse.

So the Patriots won 2 Super Bowl since the last time the Giants beat them.

Pats are 1st among the losers again.

Super Bowl LIII, Giants will beat them a 3rd time.
@Russ__III Don’t get me wrong Montana was fantastic. But Brady throwing for 505 yards and no ints (screen game strong) in a Super Bowl...don’t think he cost them the game

@bostonfan32323 @willmarcheski7 @FTFonFS1 @Patriots @Seahawks @Giants Guys, it was a idiotic play call.

Yes because that totally ruined New England. They still won the AFC title 45-7 in the “deflategate” game and went on to win the super bowl. And even though Brady was suspended in 2016, he still came back and led them to a super bowl. That is absolutely petty. Wow. Disgraceful. https://t.co/T7ek8cW6A8

@HeyMom418 Just think Mary..This Malcolm Butler Super Bowl debacle. Now this Josh McDaniels mess..I'm liking this..😂😂
@NoraPrinciotti Did they watch Super Bowl call Frank Reich
The eagles won the super bowl, the Patriots may not have Tom Brady or Bill Bellicheck next year and Donald Trump is the president...... it’s only February. Expect the Unexpected?
@ThaTrillKCJ Brady threw for 500 in the super bowl and they lost by 10 wym lol
@fcoxx_91 just a Mississippi boy got Mississippi mud on my boots! Congrats homeboy on winning super bowl
SUPER BOWL CHAMPIONS!!!!!!!
@alxterrell @Gethin76 did you know @JayTrain was born in London? He was rocking the 🇬🇧 on the field after #SuperBowl.

Fuck it @JimIrsay where do I email my resume? What you got to lose? I’ll win ya a super bowl next year guaranteed and i’ll be the patriots worst nightmare. Sign me the fuck up!
@intrepid0237343 good call there feels like collingsworth calling the superbowl
@Education4Libs Is it not cool to crunch??  Oh darn!! Luckily (in more ways than 1) there were no  #feminists at r #superbowl party...! #doritosforwomen
@snyder_dave I am not. I’ll watch on tv. The Super Bowl live was a fair trade-off
Yo, Nick Foles is a super bowl MVP.
Ok but honestly Gaga needs to see when this same little girl was so mad she wasn’t performing at the Super Bowl halftime this year 🤣 https://t.co/UUagJsIAAQ
Tom Brady has the most Super Bowl losses as a starting QB. Only two less losses than Lebron has in the Finals. Except Lebron has only been on the team favored to win 2 of his 8, where as the Patriots were the favorite to win in 6 of their 8 Super Bowls in the Brady era.
This Jr High basketball game is more entertaining than the Super Bowl 🏀

EAGLES THURSDAY 🦅 #Superbowl #FlyEaglesFly #ImThere
@NFL @SuperBowl Who else wants to see a Jay Gruden/Jon Gruden Super Bowl? @Redskins will get revenge on their SB rival the @RAIDERS with Alex Smith who probably hates the Raiders by now.
@NFL @SuperBowl Pats
@yemedeportes @carlosyeme @Anuaryeme La Baja de rating del super bowl se debió más a la adnimatversión sobre pats y la poca convocatoria de eagles? Ó los fans disminuyen?
This is really dumb. But seven years ago I spent the entire Super Bowl promising to predict who would win the game on Facebook. https://t.co/DQOWXZ2k2u

@Mac_BZ if you come to the @49ers and win a #superbowl they'll have 1 more than the @Patriots ...just saying! you know @JimmyG_10 the truth!
Listening to all of this post Super Bowl @Patriots drama like... https://t.co/zwB6jYRQQr
@EmmaFyffe don't know if you noticed but one of the super bowl commercials had the actress Sarah Hagan who was one of the Slayer potentials in Buffy. I totally Geeked out with glee.
@MikeSielski this is wonderful journalism. So in the end,  Andy Reid, by bringing two men back to the NFL who had been cast aside, helped bring the #Eagles Superbowl championship after all... https://t.co/F9gRyFrDB6
UPDATE: she flys into Philadelphia at 11. Right before the super bowl parade starts!! I swear she is the luckiest person i know! 😩
@elonmusk @SpaceX this looks like a Super Bowl commercial: too absurd to be anything but CG. #falconheavy #spacex https://t.co/AyZ2ECTerJ
@Eagles won the Super Bowl but @Patriots crushing the off-season drama bowl.
Honestly the only good thing about the eagles Super Bowl win is that the riots that ensued afterwards destroyed the set of its always sunny in Philadelphia so I’ll never have to watch another episode of that show

I’m still stunned that the 3rd string running back took a direct snap, pitched it to the 3rd string tight end, who proceeded to throw a touchdown to the 2nd string QB. On 4th down. In the SUPER BOWL. https://t.co/LZGXKK2SXB
Hey @ShopRiteStores, your Nutley, NJ store really let my friend @NjTank99 down on Super Bowl Sunday. He ordered the Wunderbar Bologna from the Deli Kiosk and they didn’t give it to him. His Super Bowl Sandwich was RUINED. Ruining a man’s super bowl meal is basically treason!

@JrgLaw @terryhannan Yes they are and I am a die hard Cowboy fan, born and bred, but I appreciate a great game and it was! I was just pissed that the media wanted to focus on Brady and give him a press conference instead of  The Eagles and it was the franchise first Super Bowl  win! Forget Brady!

Whelp, this aged well. Absolutely love that McDaniels is going to stick with a team that has a far better chance of getting back to the Super Bowl in the next few years, and that Kraft may have just stuck it to you guys. https://t.co/xSViHwL5b7

@JohnMichaels929 @AtlantaFalcons I think Matt would go for a slight raise but with all of it guaranteed. Also with incentives for winning playoffs and a Super Bowl.
Eagles establishes in 1933.
1933. Eagles win Super Bowl 52. 19+33=52. I’m a numbers guy... I’m sure someone else figured this out, but I haven’t seen it yet.                             1933.... SUPER BOWL 52....

The @mmschocolate #SuperBowl Ad was so funny. #SDLive #WWENonStop
I still can’t get over the 4th &amp; 5 philly converted in the Super Bowl. No hesitation, no timeout just preparation and confidence in film study. They knew they were getting man-to-man and defeated the team on the other side of the ball with fundamentals.
@KTisclutch Easily his best Super Bowl performance but 'he' lost so ridiculousness like this follows.
Derek Barnett's fumble recovery might be the most underrated catch in Super Bowl history.

Look at how quickly easily he snags that ball. If he stumbles, they probably lose the game. This kid's football sense is unreal. https://t.co/Ti91cGYuz6

i mean there was a super bowl commercial with the song lmao https://t.co/GRCng51w25
Now my throat wants to be horse, a few days after the Super Bowl, still worth it
Just recently we watched #TheTwoBills which also featured #robertkraft, &amp; his never ending craftiness in dealing w/ the @nfl League office.

You can tell the Sixers are playing a lot looser because there is less pressure on them because the Eagles won the super bowl.
Forgot we got eagles super bowl cake in the house lol
@casspa It was about insurance companies using social media to determine the outcome of claims. Somehow they found me from that article. Also the key subject was about how Gronk got robbed during the Superbowl.

It’s barley hitting me we won this thing. Super bowl champs ... so surreal. Thought I’d never see the day. No more teasing.
@jillianmele That will go down as one of the greatest plays in Super Bowl history. It’ll be on highlights for decades!!!

I had this pic all along and missed a perfect opportunity for a Superbowl meme https://t.co/wyiPrcxQ6U
For some working parents the unexpected school day off for the @Eagles #SuperBowl parade is an added stress to find child care; for others it’s a once in a life opportunity to share with your child. @6abc

@smithjoel86 @CanadaBearFan @SI_PeterKing @Eagles should hold out for more @NickFoles_9 is definitely a starter in this league especially under frank Reich. If his ceiling is his performance in the super bowl then that’s still really good. 778 yards and 7 touchdowns on the biggest stage, that’s worth a first round pick

I just bawled my eyes out watching @insidetheNFL’s Super Bowl LII highlights when they talked about Lilly Foles someday understanding what her father did. #eagles
@Trags I’m loving observing all this speculation and analysis of the Pats since super bowl.
These three days between the superbowl and the parade have felt like the longest three days of my life
@Colts THANK YOU #LilBabyJesus for not letting us get stuck with #JoshMcDaniels #NowHeresAGuy who couldn't win a super bowl with #TomBrady &amp; #BillBelichick
@TonyDungy Coach Dungy: Coach the Colts! Perfect fit. You’ll have them in Super Bowl in 2018 or 2019 #Patriots #Colts #nfl #espn

@Guido227 @IndyStarSports @Colts @JimIrsay Maybe you should look at McDaniels and the fact he verbally agreed to terms, had the Colts start hiring assistants already prior to the Super Bowl that expected Josh to be there. No one does that in the league.
Super Bowl Champion Philadelphia Eagles. It just doesn’t get old.  Not sure it ever will. #FlyEagleaFly
My parents were watching a show about the eagles and the Superbowl and I guess I was chewing too loud cause they sent me to my room :/
It’s Tuesday night and I have yet to fully process that the Philadelphia Eagles are Super Bowl Champions.

Just got asked by a professor at Walmart why I wasn’t in class. My excuse, the super bowl was Sunday.

@Miami_news123 It takes more than a QB to take a team to the playoffs. Just look it Nick Foles with the Rams, look it him now, super bowl QB. RT is good enough but he needs an OL, TE and yes, a wr too. He has never had this type of support in he’s career.

Yo @Patriots you just lost the super bowl to a backup QB, Brady and Belicheck are about to retire, and you just traded your next best QB options. Karma is a bitch and @CaptAndrewLuck is coming for ya

The more I look back on it that super bowl half time show was probably the best one in years

I mean look @Eagles, if @MalcolmJenkins, @TorreySmithWR and @JOEL9ONE don’t want to visit the White House after winning the #SuperBowl, that’s on them. I just love the idea of being afforded the opportunity to visit such a historic place. Again, think about it. https://t.co/YrmI0hau8y
@foxandfriends considering they have never won a superbowl before .. we can assume they will never visit the white house n meet the potus ,, slick move
#eagles win the #Superbowl #flyers win in OT and the #sixers win against a playoff team. God damn feels good.

@kwinfield_51 @kobebryant yeah that was cool! Good for him. Texans are close to being a SuperBowl team. Could be me soon!

Foles Playoff run and Super Bowl win was very reminiscent of Flacco’s. If I was a GM I’d only consider him if I had a great Oline and want to groom a rookie QB. Win win. But also, Wentz has gotten injured two years in a row and Foles is a cheap quality backup or Eagles. #keephim

Will Smith a GENIUS!! Got on IG early enough to gain the world as his followers. Even did the movie for the eagles in the SuperBowl. Then dropped the promo parody of @officialjaden new visual Icon.(which is fire Af) just to get anyone else who aint already see it to go watch it.
If anyone is wondering about my sports priorities, I went to my students’ baseball scrimmage the day after the Super Bowl because baseball season can’t get here fast enough. ⚾️💜❤️💙
Weird day. Found out I won squares for the super bowl. 400 bucks, but then feel like I’m getting the flu again, and got my first flu bill in the mail today, so basically #genesis urgent care and #cvs won squares in the super bowl worth 400 bucks.
@KFCBarstool Would you sacrifice yourself if it meant jets fans could experience a super bowl win?
I love reading my friends from phillys posts after the eagles won the super bowl “it looks like the purge is happening in philly” savage; but I’m so glad I don’t live there anymore philly fans you wild 😂😂😂
@GlennDOrdway @bostonsportsdsk So Josh replacing Bill became Brady is 0-3 as mvp in the super bowl sucks to pats plus gronk retiring lol

What was weird about this one was that I did my application for it around noon-ish on Sunday, then at 8:43 pm that same day during the fourth quarter of the Super Bowl I got called for the interview...never has that happened before!

@PP_Rubens It IS a #superbowl if the finest form..... Touchdown!!!! But gently, I wouldn't want to damage it.
@PC_Tech911 Gazillions of hotel inventory especially from Olympics. For my annual #SuperBowl week vaca, I usually arrive the weekend before and stay as late as I can during game week.
This is not an exciting story but damnit i feel good venting bc i didn't even care about this super bowl but here i am still traveling!! #mySBtrip
@iamdryx It's definitely jokes. I mean I would love to see Beyoncé every year but that would do take the fun out of the Superbowl show changing evey year. She gave us 2013 AND 2016. I'm content.

@Ron_Clements @MichaelDavSmith Kind of tough on Dallas. That was one unusual week of winter weather. DFW doesn’t have the snow gear. But don’t know if Jerry Jones deserves to run another Super Bowl. He messed that one up.
@Kappadoc1 @BleacherReport Yeah it was but Eagles are Super Bowl Champs!!!!!
@AnnCoulter I boycotted the @NFL not the @Eagles. I did not watch the Super Bowl. Waiting for the XFL. #BoycottNFL forever!

Rewatching the Super Bowl.... I tell ya what, you would of thought Chris Collinsworth was under contract for the Pats. His commentary was beyond annoying. Might as well been saying “We” when talking at about them.
@chuckd_2323 Hostage? He was busy with the super bowl - Colts made a business decision to stick with him during that.  Nothing is in stone until it’s in stone. I’ve seen too much backfire before a candidate has started a job I’ve recruited them for

@arevalo_102 @ElNinoMickey83 @itsDwillTho It wasn't my prediction lol
It was the guy I mentioned.  But it's not about if his prediction was right or wrong. He proved in the beginning of the season that it was going to be  eagles vs pats and had gotten all the Superbowl matchups right the past 5 years.
@CBSDFW I remember in downtown Dallas in 1993 win Dallas Cowboys won the Super Bowl they did the same stuff and  trying to beat up White people too Robbing stores in downtown Dallas everywhere
Something to note heading into the Olympics: @nbc convinced many advertisers to spend big on packaged commercial deals for both the Super Bowl and Olympics.

When I seen @21savage at work for the superbowl I instantly was like pew pew pew 🤣 boaaaa dat man had his lean and everything lbs #21savage #SuperBowl52
3 days after the super bowl and I still have no voice. @Eagles
@NFLTotalAccess. every year during a Superbowl New England is always in some type of controversy.
@cj_wentz Actually, @NickFoles_9 was the one who got you that ring. You had nothing to do with that in the playoffs. Was one of the best Super Bowl games I've seen in a while. Congratulations on your engagement and congratulations for @NickFoles_9 for getting you that ring.
In a way I’m glad you think the city is destroyed. Scum bags like you will stay away and never get to enjoy how much of a family this city really is. So believe whatvya want and stay away, we all we got we all we need. Super bowl champs, our famadelphia eagles https://t.co/3B7NAL6tGP

Super Bowl in Atlanta next year. the one time they need to have an all rap halftime show is next year
His original pitch was 5-7 years to contend.
And they bring in the Ringless Fossil not even 2.5 years in.
Absolutely gutless.

Keep moving forward. 

Thanks, @NFoles_9. A champion’s perspective.

Lol. They’re struggling in New York since the Giants’ Super Bowl win in 2012. It could reach 59 “ringless campaigns” by summer. https://t.co/A7y9Vi5BN3
@joslewis I couldn’t be happier, but with that being said the performance of the defense was horrible. As expected they mirrored what the Giants did in 2 games, and even more, we’re so lucky we played Atlanta instead of the Saints and Brees. But we prevailed and we’re Super Bowl Champions!
"The #Eagles seem daring when they run an offensive play instead of punting on fourth down, but the calls are simply managing risk for optimum outcome. The Eagles average 4.7 points on drives that include a converted fourth down." #SuperBowl

@KyleBrandt Lets be real here. New England lost the Super Bowl but and everyone should be talking about the EAGLES. But no New England has to grab all the head lines. Every year there in a Super Bowl there is always some kind of controversy. Also no class shity move

Whatever you think of the Patriots as a football team, Rob Gronkowski did not deserve to have his house robbed while he was playing the Super Bowl. (Or ever, obviously.) But, the cold calculation of ransacking his home while he was at the game.  Sure hope they catch the idiots.

Your team isn’t the 2017-2018 super bowl champion? You peasants disgust me
@SuMoSpeak need to respect him? No one should mandate that they have to go.  Everybody isnt ok with going alomg to get along.  Same way u ask what is not going doing what is going doing? Some hold strong convictions; winning the Superbowl doesnt negate that.
Pro Tip:

Don’t eat stuffed hot peppers from the Super Bowl Party before you go to bed

If the Patriots win that super bowl, BB, TB12, Gronk all retire and McDaniels/Patricia both walk for HC jobs. Instead they lost and it is screwing up everything.

@KGArea21 @Migos @iamcardib Cardi would've been dope, but you know the Super Bowl isn't about to have any hip hop artists up there. Then again, I heard Jigga was asked and he said no. A lot of rappers, I feel, would've said no. Next year's Super Bowl may be a different story. Rap would have it lit.

@JoeGiglioSports @dark____master this dude should never have a job coaching again. He had Keenum, Foles, Goff and as soon as all three were no longer with him, playoffs and one beat Brady and got the super bowl MVP. Whata joke
The MLK estate wouldn’t let “Selma” use his speeches, but they let Dodge for its Super Bowl Ram *commercial*?? Just drew that connection. Wtf.
One thing they will never be able to take away from Foles is Super Bowl MVP.  That dude earned it and now Wentz has to do the same.

I been on some shxt since Sunday....if ya team never won a Super Bowl....don't talk to me about football😭😭😭
Thinking about it now, it’s probably for the best that the @Patriots lost the #SuperBowl, idk if America could handle another celebration tour from @RobGronkowski
If you are a Falcon/Bama fan our 28-3 lose in super bowl makes you ineligible to say anything about blown leads sonsit down
The patriots didn’t win the Super Bowl because the Footballs were inflated properly
I'm off tomorrow for the #Superbowl parade. I'm excited. My #Eagles are CHAMPS!!!!!
@SKYLERDIGG There’s literally black people there dude. Let’s just say If it wasn’t an Eagles super bowl they’d all be taken in

@bielawski15 no, I’ve been pretty fortunate that I can consider a Super Bowl loss from my favorite team as the worst time of my life tbh.
Eagles Update; Eagles players &amp; fans openly cry at Super Bowl win, Coach Doug Peterson speaks for many: "We are a gutsy hard working blue collar team, with a lot of unselfish players &amp; coaches willing to just get the job done.This is the new norm in Philadelphia; written in ink."
Well, my yo-yo @WeightWatchers journey continues. I lost 3 lbs this week! Happy result after taking a 4-hour Super Bowl hiatus! That makes 15 lbs lost in 5 weeks... 5 lbs and 5 weeks to go!
@pmclellan Got this for my super bowl party. It was gone with a quickness. Please send moar.
Between the Super Bowl and the Parade I'm worried that we are going to be crushed under a pile of cans and bottles before trash day comes around

@PaulaMa59 @PoliticusSarah @oufenix The Super Bowl announcer said it near the end of the game. If you have a problem with it, take it up with Foles or NBC Sports. Mixing sports and religion is both absurd and sacrilegious. As if any God that might exist would care about a football game. Seriously, get a life.
Asking a new head coach if he can win a super bowl on his first day for his new franchise in the next season is completely asinine. #Lions

I love that Kevin Hart got rejected by security at Super Bowl.....nervy little fella
@SMC_IUPUI @Grady Raiders/Chiefs, Cowboys/Redskins, Eagles/Giants, Patriots/Jets, &amp; Packers/Bears to name a few are rivalries. When Peyton was QB of the Colts you could consider Patriots a rival since the winner was more than likely Super Bowl bound. Since Peyton left that isn't the case.
All the Superbowl scenes on Sunday's #ThisIsUs episode was from Sunday's actual Superbowl. That's so dope.

The year is 2020, the @49ers are playing the @Patriots in the Super Bowl. The @49ers are led by Bill Belichick and @JimmyG_10 while the @Patriots are led by 42 year old Tom Brady and Josh McDaniels. Then and only then will @NFL get me back. #CantWait

Thought i’d care more about the Eagles finally getting a Super Bowl but tbh good for them. Its about time honestly.
@antonio79461319 @gilltherevenant @jessica_smetana @L_Bell26 @Lions I didn't say it would be smart, but as a Lions fan and a Spartan, I'd love to see him in Detroit. As for the super bowl thing, the current Detroit Lions plus Bell? No. But I believe in Patricia, I believe we will be a playoff team, and one of the pieces we will get soon is an RB.

I had a great time in Minneapolis working with Ford during Super Bowl 52! I even made some new… https://t.co/Asy3Drqxow
I need a @greengoblin Super Bowl Jersey asap help a bro out 😩🔥
I'm celebrating the Jets Superbowl victory now because teams like that only win after you die.

I hope they prove me wrong.

@johnrobertsFox Yes. I think President Trump wants to honor our military. We honor the Super Bowl and World Series winners with a parade. They have been at war since 9/11 so why not show our support in such a neat way?
@coziestvillian @ArmoryEvents Because he is hosting a super bowl party tomorrow and doesn't give a shit about The Bay? 🤔 https://t.co/isI3tLxGfm
One of my favorite moments of Super Bowl LII weekend; showing off my Pats tatt with the help of @AlbertBreer https://t.co/OHii1UNrmG
Best ad during the super bowl. Danny DeVito is a national treasure. https://t.co/1PQofhvIlH
These Eagles Super Bowl hats are wild when the flash hits them! https://t.co/J1WqhCJD4X
@shalisemyoung I get your take but normally employers get a chance to counter offers before final decisions are made.  Nfl needs to look at this and fix it.  No team should be allowed to make personnel moves until after superbowl!

I just realized I didn’t see a single Bubble Bowl joke on super bowl sunday
@NFL @AaronRodgers12 @packers I loved that day when the Packers were the super bowl champions.
Why do professional Patriots fans constantly write about their “experience” watching the super bowl every year like anyone outside of Boston gives a shit?

I’m seriously devastated I won’t be in Philly tomorrow. But luckily we are still Super Bowl Champs and i’ll watch from home.

North Dakota Governor Burgum says he will repay Xcel Energy for Super Bowl tickets in statement. Also the governor’s office says it is working on creating an ethics policy which it does not have.
No one should be angry at Josh McDaniels except for Indy.    The NFL is solely to blame.   If they made all teams wait until after the superbowl to choose personnel,  this would never happen!

@GoldBlooded44 @NinersNation Wouldn't cry either brother Malcolm is a football player and saved a Superbowl loss but he gives strength to big receivers which is why  I'm back on the courtland Sutton train big receivers are the hardest to defend given fast receivers give the safety a immediate Target
I still can't believe we won the fucking super bowl
@ActuallyBarkley Better than Pete Carroll in that Superbowl 😉
363 days until Super Bowl 53 in Atlanta, Georgia
One of my favorite #SuperBowl ads!! https://t.co/ky7wXZbQz8
@TonyDungy I totally agree with you Tony and really appreciate your professional and faith based views! Besides that, what a great message from the MVP in his post Super Bowl comments! I am sincerely grateful for both of you!
Spending 5 Million on a super bowl ad about how you helped the islands damaged by hurricanes does seem wasteful.  🤷🏽‍♂️
I still can’t believe after ALL that the @Eagles went through this season, we STILL won a Super Bowl. Like.... it’s over. 😭 #FlyEaglesFly #SBLII
Why don't the NFL play Super Bowls in the Rose Bowl anymore? They did it a lot when I was a kid 🤔
Went to get haircut at sports clips… Of course they’re showing the last 20 minutes of the Super Bowl #Ugh #FuqMan
Oh no problem. Got plenty of time. I only got @AfronerdRadio &amp; @totalintent at 7pm @WWENXT @thexfiles and @LibrariansTNT at 8pm another blog to complete and a stack of books to read before #NCBD tomorrow. Yeahhhh time. https://t.co/GVFXPDkHNh

I worked on a patient today who didn’t watch the super bowl? Like that had JT performing? https://t.co/XLxhmhIEoC
I know people hate hearing how brilliant the Patriots are, but look at the facts. Eagles win their 1st Super Bowl EVER and all that sports radio has talked about for three days is Malcom Butler and Josh McDaniels...aka...the Patriots!!  #NextLevelBrilliant #WinWhenYouLose
The #Eagles won the #SuperBowl and that should make all #Redskins fans sad. We also re-evaluate the Alex Smith trade. Lastly, we breakdown the recent successful stretch for the #Wizards #DCFamily #DCsports https://t.co/pvb7TuGILE

I'm going to be very tired at work tomorrow. I'll be staying up really late tonight so that I can ignore the Super Bowl. #SuperBowl2017
Matthew's SuperBowl party is a disaster as he doesn't have the channel broadcasting the game. Jimmy is outbid for an ad slot and is furious.
Lady Gaga WILL make a political statement during the #SuperBowl half time show

Was hoping #dolphins was gonna make the #SuperBowl this year. Wasn't to be so I'll be cheering on the best in the AFC in the #Patriots 🏈🏈🏈
£9.60 for a standard bottle of beer and £11.20 for a premium at the #SuperBowl crazy.
@paddypower the sky sports commentator for the Super Bowl to shout 'AND IT'S LIVE' at the start #whatoddspaddy
Well whatever happens this evening it's been a helluva of a season and such a fun team to watch @AtlantaFalcons #RiseUp #SuperBowl
All ready for the Super Bowl with SS1!!
@steboost Now that's what I call a super-bowl.
Should be drunk in the SU waiting for the Super Bowl, not in bed with my alarm for 6am
As if people will stay up to watch that Super Bowl shite
I'm increasingly torn between BBC for no adverts, Sky for the better analysis and just finding a Fox stream for the US adverts. #SuperBowl
In fact, I have an idea. I'm going to record it and watch it when I get up. #SB51 #SuperBowl
MOTD leading into the Superbowl. Noice
In NFL games you can have up to 12 named captains taking part in a coin toss; but only one of them's allowed to call heads/tails #SuperBowl

If you're undecided about who to support in the Super Bowl, the Patriots' owner, coach and star player are all Trump enthusiasts, so...
If the Falcons triumph in the #Superbowl tonight will Sean Spicer announce the Patriots as the winners? #AlternativeFacts
Time does #SuperBowl start?
@Ian_M1 It's ok, I've got the week off. Come On The #Falcons #SuperBowl
Every year I say the same thing, will I beat my Superbowl record of staying awake.... current record is the 3rd quarter 3 years ago. 😯 #NFL

I enjoy Twitter during the Super Bowl more than the Super Bowl itself...😂
Both teams trying to throw the game so they don't have to endure the #Trump congratulatory call after the game...

I find it confusing what's printed on the pitch and what is graphics. #SuperBowl
@ellis_platten that's like saying not to watch your videos if you don't like football. Still haven't seen any frosties at the superbowl :(
Been a bit underwhelming so far #SuperBowl
@D6MERIT Tom Brady looks nervey tonight sacked already a couple times in the first quarter. #SuperBowl

@KAYDM49 I don't think they will play the super bowl at Upton Park
Why does American footy team need seperate offence and defence players? Just get players that are good at both, like rugby! #SuperBowl

2,28.. 2,28.. throws up a brick into a Hail Mary within the tightend wide receiver, in the 48 on 3rd #SuperBowl boom touchdown baby 👀👀👀👀😂😂😂🙈
Starting the Super Bowl trailers off strong with Guardians - that's going to be a tough one to beat.

Rugby je větší zábava, ale #SuperBowl jsem neminul posledních 6 let ani jednou
@JaguarsUK idea for next years Super Bowl! Have 52 SB parties around the uk and spread the #ukjags word
Tom Brady looks like the guy who queues behind you in the chippy in a hoody and hi vis while rolling a fag #SuperBowl #TomBrady

I am shattered but can't sleep. I might put the  #SuperBowl on. Should be asleep in about 45 seconds 😴😴😴😴
Watching my first ever #SuperBowl, and my first ever game of hand egg, don't have a fucking clue what's going on
Watching the start of @SuperBowl on @BBCSport . Beer ready. Bourbon ready. Come on. Hope I last out. Oh, did I mention #ManFlu ? https://t.co/2q2H3HgqeN

Four years ago Danny Amendola was a co-host on Ch4's Super Bowl coverage. Now he's playing. Hope he loses.
Watching the super bowl in London with no commercials is such a let down
Thought I'd give the #SuperBowl a try. Nah. I just don't get a sport in which 75% of the time, the clock is on stop... 😴😴😴 Bed time
WHAT IS A SUPER BOWL?¿
WHAT A START TO THE SUPERBOWL #NotEvenWatching
Even the Wales/Italy game was more exciting than this #superbowl
#SuperBowl
#SuperBowl 1st time I'm watching it,stop,start, stop, start!! The game don't flow!!!
IM. SO. EXCITED. #LADYGAGA #SUPERBOWL #SB51
Jeeez this super bowl crack stop start stop start worse then a scratched DVD🤣🤔
Which @SuperBowl halftime show has been your favourite in recent years
Brady is ice cool. #SuperBowl
Watching the Super Bowl in London means English commentators and no commercials, so odd.
The #SuperBowl has kicked off @thelexington. Food from #BunThat and drink available all night, Lady Gaga performs at 1am (on screen that is) https://t.co/nS1XM4bjBR
Really looking forward to the remaining 11 minutes and 30 seconds of #SuperBowl playtime ! https://t.co/2TI9MMCBsx
@Joe_Sugg you watching the Superbowl? 🏈 https://t.co/P4Hi7ksxat
HALF TIME? 🏈 #NFL #SuperBowl #PepsiHalftime #LadyGaga
Would love Falcons to win but Brady. #SuperBowl
Wanting to watch the Superbowl but then realising that realistically I can't stay awake for a 10 minute conversation never mind that long.
Oh no that poor expensive camera! #SuperBowl
It's not really sport. It's just people standing around. I move more during my commute to work than they do in the whole game #SuperBowl
#SuperBowl #letsgopatriots #NewEnglandPatriots #SuperBowlSunday
Watching the Super Bowl in England. The ads have been taken away...
Kindle Fire in the bedroom kept pausing so I've had to get out of bed. On the sofa now, #SuperBowl viewing resumed.
It's SuperBowl, so I'm reminded once again of this:

Either you know why, or you don't.
Google Home going off during the #superbowl Google Home ads 😂
Not a @AtlantaFalcons fan, but I'd like to see Brady have stinker!  #SuperBowl
Oh Jeez! Poor cameraman! #SuperBowl
Ayesha revealed in #GuardiansoftheGalaxyVol2 Super Bowl spot. https://t.co/IGkRiQao0C
Take out the staff too. Why not? #SuperBowl #SB51

First #SuperBowl ad break: meh.

Two NFC East fans watching the #superbowl with some @brewdog #elvisjuice from #glasgow #nfl… https://t.co/7TWepp74eO
All the gays into Super Bowl tonight
I'm not even a big NFL fan but I've been watching the superbowl every year for a while now
@Barishnikoff I plan on binge watching the people v oj tomorrow which having watched the 1st ep before the Superbowl I can't wait
Not bothering with #SuperBowl tonight dont get the appeal of it but not going to be 1 of those who tweets saying they're not going to watch😏
It's actually mad how little I care about the Super Bowl
Nothing ever happens. Ever. They stand around and talk. Then do sweet fuck all. #SuperBowl
Love how the BBC are calling it 'American Football' and not the #SuperBowl #SuperBowlSunday  @ladyhob
Gotta be having the #Patriots tonight. Can't be having a divisional rival winning the Super Bowl #whodat
LETS GOOOOOO SUPERBOWL @Beth_M_Macey @AaronIrwin7 @JackBramhillFG #SuperBowl
Super Bowl? Super bored. Far too many breaks for my tiny mind to deal with. And anyway, I could never decide...49'ers or Detroit Lions.
When people won't shut up while your trying to watch the Superbowl 😡😠
Did Sky have problems with visas to get into the USA for the Superbowl? UK studio-based presentation extremely flat.
Superbowli Ravioli give me the Formuoli #SuperBowl
I'm watching the Super Bowl. I literally haven't a clue what is happening
Will ic3man82's luck continue and the #patriots with the #SuperBowl ? #tbtvgc2017
Superbowl https://t.co/mEj8n7MCmX
Super Bowl!!!! Let's go Patriots🏈
Enjoying the adverts with the odd break of football #SuperBowlSunday #SuperBowl
I like how the coach is casually plaing doodle jump on his iPad. #SuperBowl
Watching the superbowl hope Falcons win
@MitchellDisney apparently not! Haha that's all I'm waiting for! #SuperBowl
Could you get a more perfect name for a kicker than Bosher? #SuperBowl
From a British perspective I don't get what's going on but it's kinda fun to watch, a lot more interesting than UK football. #SuperBowl
I have no idea what's going on 😳 #SuperBowl #SuperBowlSunday #SuperBowl2017 🏈

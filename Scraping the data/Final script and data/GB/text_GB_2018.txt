Why do we keep having the same people play the Super Bowl? It’s like we have a rotation. Next year it’ll be Bruno Mars then we’ll be back to the top of the line up with Beyonce. You should get to play it ONCE and then we all move on and give someone else a chance.
Oooh! V. bad call @espn. Unnecessary cruelty. 15 yd penalty &amp; a boycott of your coverage of #SuperBowl enforced at the kick off. Lots of vegans &amp; vegetarians (&amp; meat eaters generally) will be hugely unimpressed. Take down the ad..There are other ways of marketing. @NFL @NFLUK https://t.co/IdliB7NP18

Tomorrow, it’s Super Bowl Sunday. I can’t believe that’s it and over til September. In fact, I’ll be watching the first Sunday of the new season on my honeymoon in Singapore if can find a bar to show it! 😂
@Fanatics I made a couple of purchases from yourselves by buying Super Bowl woolly hat and eagles flag. But for some reason these were sent out in 2 separate packets. One of the items I had bought for someone for the game before they head off overseas on this coming Monday but now I won’t
Its tomorrow! Super Bowl at @quessmokehouse Ques Smokehouse in Ashford. I'll be there performing some table magic.

@RChurchill26 Perfect as well seeing as only just played redskins this season so baring a Super Bowl match up won’t play/see Alex again until his 4th &amp; final year
Super Bowl seems like a big deal but I've never watched it. What's the point? I'd be toothbrush cat staring at the TV. Confused. No idea what's happening
Guys. Its SuperBowl day!
.. Oh, missed a tip - catch a power nap, coffee, pizza or  whatever during half time show - always dreadful @NFLUK @SuperBowl
Tip for 1st time UK/IRE @SuperBowl fans. You can try Sky Sports Mix for preamble (don’t even think of signing with @NFLGamePassEU❌)  but then it has to be @BBCOne with @markchapman @OsiUmenyiora @JasonBell33 for fun &amp; expert analysis. And you avoid the awful US ads 👍 https://t.co/wtCKbFAEzb

Today’s the only day I’ll watch the NFL because it’s the #SuperBowl
Why is work so busy today? The Super Bowl is tonight, shouldn’t people be at home pretending they care about american football?
Its #SuperBowl day! Routing for the eagles tonight because Tom Brady is the most annoyingly smug man alive https://t.co/QyHtzll5D9
Am I the only one that really doesn't give a toss about this Superbowl thingy.
As a giants fan couldn't really be two teams id like to win it less tonight but it's still the #superbowl and I'll still be watching #FlyEaglesFly #GoPats

What takeaway should I have for super bowl ? #SuperBowl52
I think this is definitely the least excited for a Super Bowl I’ve been since I started watching the sport. Is there no possible way that both teams can lose?
Struggling with these ads. Both professionally and as a consumer. But I’m sure sales will go thru the roof at Super Bowl. Does that actually mean a job well done? https://t.co/FjuxSGcwKJ

Cool part about making European friends: referring to American football as  “hand egg” and the super bowl as  “the hand egg tournament.” Tonight should be fun.

I’m gonna give American football a second chance tonight with watching the superbowl, however, if I still don’t understand it by the end of play, then I’m afraid I’ll never watch it again. 🏈
@NFLGirlUK The first ever Super Bowl I watched from start to finish was Super Bowl 48 between the Denver Broncos &amp; the Seattle Seahawks. #NFLUKChat #SuperBowl
@NFLGirlUK For me personally it would have to be last years Super Bowl 51, what an amazing comeback victory by the patriots. #NFLUKChat

Imagine English people staying up to watch that super bowl. The sport is shit. There's only one football.
For any confused British people, the Superbowl is like the American version of the Great British Bake Off final, except the result doesn’t matter as much..

I don’t like either team and really I’ll be watching as a neutral and a lover of the sport and occasion but nothing else. Certainly won’t be crying if Brady and the Pats lose. Sorry @MattBlaker ;] Tx.
What do you believe is the greatest Super Bowl you have watched since it's been broadcast live in the U.K? #NFLUKChat
In Birmingham ready for Super Bowl party but off for curry not sure who to support tonight Patriots or Eagles

Put a quid on Nick Foles to be #SuperBowl MVP because it was 6/1 and the playoffs have taught me that anything is possible
Super Bowl day always reminds me of an old American EY colleague, Chris Zahn. Think it was 04 or 05 when we watched it together in my old flat. Not sure what he’s up to now, but hope he’s doing well.
Superbowl night. Pizza Hut. Back to Wards followed by ripping the piss out of each other until about 4-30 am.  #FlyEaglesFly

@jowrotethis A UK Super Bowl party involves having a two-hour nap at 9pm in a desperate attempt to be able to stay awake till 4am. And usually booking the next day off work.
To nap or not to nap before Super Bowl tonight. Have to be up at half 6 tomorrow so will get around 3 hours sleep but think I’ll feel worse if I sleep now for a bit 🤔🤔 #nfluk #SuperBowl2018 #ukproblems

So hope I can stay awake  just to see @Pink tonight at the #SuperBowl 💖💖smash it girl... Hope your feeling better....
I’ve enjoyed the Super Bowl nonsense a lot more since I’ve chosen to see it as the Superb Owl instead. I would enjoy watching a Superb Owl a lot more I think.

#SuperBowl betting for the halftime show, who we backing? Donald Trump as a wildcard for 250/1? Or maybe you want to play it safe with Big Shaq... a Barack Obama/ Big Show duet is my pick. Remember they HAVE to actively sing #BookieBashing #SB52 #PepsiHalftime https://t.co/3h3GL6kN6Q

@gunzofthenorth Brady never scored a point in seven #SuperBowl First Quarters. History says you might struggle, but sounds like you’re on fire today.
Watching #CoachSnoop on @NetflixUK for pre-#Superbowl hype. These kid's stories are breaking my heart - such strong, broken young men. The world needs more @SnoopDogg.

Got a feeling we will get a Black Panther trailer tonight, revealing that Beyonce is in it. Has been heavily rumoured she’s got a cameo and will mean her third time of dominating the Super Bowl.

Superbowl Time! #SuperBowl
Another year of watching the #Superbowl, spending most of the time having no idea what's going on, finally getting to grips with the basics, before falling asleep and forgetting everything that happened and all I learnt. I can't be the only Brit with this problem...
American Football? WHY? not football but Throwball, and also why is Sooooo long, plus why dont you keep the same players on the pitch for the full match, instead of given then a rest after every throw, No flow to the sport
#SuperBowl
Let’s see how much of the Super Bowl I see this year 😂
Determined to stay up for the Super Bowl even no a dunno what’s going on
The Six Nations Rugby and the Super Bowl. A perfect storm of a weekend where British people try to sound like experts despite discussing a sport they know nothing about.
Stick yer Super Bowl up yer arse
My thoughts on the #SuperBowl: the #Eagles aren't much (if at all) better than last year's Falcons and they definitely aren't better than the "Legion of Boom" Seahawks.

So basically.... https://t.co/A1vKnjBFBe
Final thought for an emotional weekend (the rest of tonight will be #SuperBowl), is #CancerHasNoColours #FuckCancer
@thetandyman how many points behind do the #NewEnglandPatriots need to be before you decide to go to bed? #NeverForget #SuperBowl
Genuinely only care about the Super Bowl because of the new film trailers. Couldn't care less who wins.

Good luck to @Arsenal fan @JayTrain in the #SuperBowl tonight. It will be a difficult game against @Patriots but bring it home fella COYG!!!!
Normally would never support @Eagles but will make an exception tonight. Not just because they are playing the Pats, but also because the Nick Foles fairy tale deserves a ring to cap it off #SuperBowl
Today has been wonderful and now I’m drinking wine in prep for the #SuperBowl 

Life is VERY good
Just to be clear. I have NO interest in the Super bowl. 1 hours "entertainment" crammed into 6 hours.
I’ve still got water dripping down me from my shower racing back from Edinburgh to try make it in time for the Super Bowl 😩

The Super Bowl is a load of pish
Going to try and watch the super bowl again, tried a few times before usually last 10 minutes realise it’s shit and go sleep lol
I take it that this #SuperBowl is a bowl from Krypton sent to earth by Bowl-El to hold its cousin's pringles or something? But it crash-landed in Dipsville and got taken in by kindly farmers who always wanted a flying bowl? https://t.co/Daut84xBmY

Pulling out the mid 90's playlist as we wait for the Super Bowl. Shed Seven, Bluetones, Ocean Colour Scene.
1hr to Kick off! It's #SuperBowl peoples #NotDone #GoPats
Scotland rugby was pish to watch. Listening to #ClanRadioLive last night was entertaining. Following @hockey_laura from @FifeFlyers tonight got me on the edge of my seat. Recorder set for the NFL Super  Bowl.
Super bowl plans fell through 😫
Getting nervous now #Patriots #SuperBowl
Man don’t really watch American football but super bowl is a definite
It’s amazing how many Janet Jackson fans mysteriously crawl out when JT &amp; Super Bowl is mentioned. Go crawl back under your nipple pad.

Fuck Super Bowl. It’s all about #ThisIsUs today
Rooting for the #NewEnglandPatriots let’s do this and win the #SuperBowl

@SkySportsNFL when I wake up in the morning I pray the eagles have landed and they are Super Bowl victors.
If I stay up till 5am just to watch Brady win another superbowl I'm gonna be fuckin pissed. Let's go Eagles #SuperBowlSunday #SuperBowl #NewEnglandPatriots #PhiladelphiaEagles #FlyEagelsFly

So let’s see how long I can manage of the super bowl this year. Last year went to bed at half time and missed the incredible 2nd half and OT by the patriots. Expecting Patriots to win easy tonight. #SuperBowlLll #PatriotsvsEagles 🏈🏈
Would fucking kill to be at a Superbowl and you have cunts like Stormzy who couldnt tell you who Tom Brady is front row seats on the half way line. Farce

So happy to watch the Super Bowl in the UK this year. I WONT HAVE TO SUFFER THROUGH THE VOICE-OVER AND TRANSLATION AND FRENCH PRESENTERS NOT KNOWING WHO’S WHO !
#superbowl can not wait for this even if hate both teams.
And so my annual excitement at watching SuperBowl is about to begin. It usually lasts about 2 hours before I realise we've only had about 6 plays - to be fair the only time I made it to half time was when @TheWho played! #SuperBowlSunday
I don't understand the super bowl.
So... Moved into the new house today properly after officially moving yesterday, we’ve sacked Christiansen, Super League has started, Super Bowl tonight and my 8 hour tattoo sitting tomorrow. Hectic! Extraordinary!
Wish I wasn’t on an early tomorrow so I could watch the Super Bowl :(
One day I will go see the #superbowl 🏈🏈
@tomgreen23456 I hope so, can’t have the eagles finally winning a super bowl especially after the season the giants have had
Doubt I’m gonna get to watch much of the super bowl this evening as on nights. Be kind suffolk. 😂

Need more pressure on Brady. #FlyEagelsFly #SuperBowl
Even though I hate the @Patriots. I really want them to lose for that idiot arrogant enough to tattoo them winners of the #SuperBowl earlier this week...#Wanker

@NatalieEvans85 @DailyMirror @JackRathborn @Mark_Jones86 @ZoeShenton @SteveRobson04 @JBLongmore @joshwehays @Nick_Hedley @MirrorNFL @MirrorSport No 12 was also Joe Namath's number when he led the NY Jets to win over the Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl III putting the AFC in contention against the then sep NFL. Great tragedy was his knee injuries . Today we now know all about concussions against which there is no protection.
Made a bet with Aine on the Super Bowl... if Eagles win - I need to cook dinner and do dishes for a week. If Patriots win- I have a weeks pass to play Fortnite without nagging. #SuperBowlLll #Fortnite #Patriots

Great opening drive by the #Eagles but ultimately a big defensive stand by the #Patriots restricts Philadelphia to a FG #SuperBowl
LET’S GO TOM!!! LET’S GO!!! 🐐🐐🐐 #SuperBowl #SuperBowlLII #Patriots #GoPats #PatriotsNation #PatsNation #NFL #GoPats #NotDone

I'll choose a side, GO SEAHAWKS.
@elviodieg Yon stadium has a roof... #Superbowl
Unexpected Eagles score in the Patriots Victory Parade Zone... #SuperBowl @SkySportsNFL 🏈 #PHIvsNE
Hopefully the advertising won’t be interrupted by too much Super Bowl tonight...
So, I’m sure the #SuperBowl is great when you know what’s happening (I’m lying), but I don’t get why it keeps stopping! It just gets going &amp; they take a break! 🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️
Not sure what all the fuss is about the superbowl, I have one,I put fruit in it.
Imagine getting that far in the first drive, then getting a flag and having to settle for a field goal.. #SuperBowl
Everyone’s huge American football fans when it’s the super bowl 🙈🙈🙈

As I've got a week off work I've decided to stay up late and watch the super bowl. It's only been on for about 10 minutes and I already haven't got a clue about what the hell is going on. I just don't get it. 😯
That’s me - feather! I’ve not a scooby what’s going on with this friggin Super Bowl lark 🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️. #SuperBowlSunday #pony
Score prediction btw 30-17 Pats #SuperBowl
It's the superbowl but all the coaches and coordinators just be on the phone ordering takeaway. Take it seriously guys.
Jamás pensé que en Inglaterra se hiciera tanto escándalo por el #SuperBowl y heme aquí en un bar a la media noche REPLETO https://t.co/XUWV3Qxf9F

Who is staying up to watch the Eagles v Patriots in the #SuperBowl52 #SuperBowl?
Love Al Michaels and Chris Collingsworth commentating #SuperBowl 🏈
Here come the Zebras #SuperBowl
#Superbowl my heart says Eagles, my head says Patriots. C’mon heart.
@Darpross I think they would be in deep shit if they done that in the Super Bowl. I think the point was already made sometime ago
If your team didn't make it to the superbowl this year. You're an eagle's fan tonight #SuperBowl
Me and @asaelliott in bed watching the Super Bowl 🤔 https://t.co/JWp2qsi8im
No matter what, I absolutley struggle to summon up any kind of interest about the Super Bowl
Watching super bowl like I understand it 😕
My thoughts exactly! #InfinityWar #DoctorStrange #SuperBowl https://t.co/QC5T4TBV9R
Solid start from Foles #Eagles #superbowl #SuperBowlLII
#SuperBowl  #SuperBowl52 After last year even if @Eagles  go 24 pts up v @Patriots  they still have the problem of The GOAT on the other side of the ball #mindgames @neilreynoldsnfl @Jeff_Reinebold
Another year of being completely baffled by the #SuperBowl
Bored of the #SuperBowl already? Read my latest blog on #drones instead! #SBLII

Wouldn’t be the Super Bowl without American style comfort food 😋 https://t.co/MF9FNW1coY
It’s that wonderful time of the year when Britain pretends to be interested in the Superbowl #SuperBowlLII
Don’t get me wrong, I’d love to be excited about The Super Bowl, I’m also curious about why it’s such a big deal, but I ain’t got the patients to watch something start at 11:30 and finish at 3:50 in the A.M #SuperBowl
These Eagle’s RPO’s proving a problem early on... #SuperBowl #SuperBowlLII #Patriots #GoPats #PatriotsNation #PatsNation #NFL #GoPats #NotDone

Got Super Bowl on pretending I know what is happening 🙄😂
And that interception and touchdown was all for nothing. Thanks Richards. Thanks. #SuperBowl #SuperBowlLII #Patriots #GoPats #PatriotsNation #PatsNation #NFL #GoPats #NotDone
Half time in our football.....pop to the loo, put the kettle on, watch 2nd half!

Half time in #SuperBowl .....go to Tesco, Pop round a friends for dinner, go on holiday, 2 hours work, grow a beard then put the kettle on and watch the 2nd half
Everybody loves a floater  #SuperBowl
Makes me laugh it is called American Football and they’ve been crap at kicking the ball all 1st half! SuperBowl #BBCSuperBowl
For god sake...why? Just why? No need to be that aggressive. Just pointless. #SuperBowl #SuperBowlLII #Patriots #GoPats #PatriotsNation #PatsNation #NFL #GoPats #NotDone
Run by Clement!!! #SuperBowl
Both teams are hungry and it's making a great game so far #superbowl
So the latest #Cloverfield film is dropping on Netflix in a few hours! Which was just revealed in a Superbowl ad!? What an exciting and ballsy move! 😱😍
Huge Play Get In #superbowl
I'd be delighted if the #Superbowl keeps this pace up - already two minutes from the half. Might end up getting a decent night's sleep!
@BBCSport Chappers how many British born NFL players have won a Super Bowl ring #BBCNFL
Hurry up and bring Justin Timberlake out lol #SuperBowl
I bore most of you with darts all year so I don't bother tweeting about the Super Bowl.
If you spell Tom Brady backwards you get Beelzebub #BBCNFL #Superbowl

Osi Umenyiora looks incredibly sharp in that suit tonight. #SuperBowl
🏈🏈🏈 TOUCHDOWN 🏈🏈🏈
@SweetFeet_White for the @Patriots’ speed reduces the @Eagles lead by six to bring the scores to 12-15!!
This is going to be one close game!!! 😊🏈👍🏻

Is blair walsh doing the kicking for these teams #SuperBowl #Seahawks
Gostkowski is having a bad night so far and then brings out the elbows to stop the run back. It’s all happening #SuperBowl #Patriots
So there’s lads on each team who’s only job is to kick the ball between the sticks. Literally that’s it. That’s what they do every day and they’ve both missed? #RayFinkle #LacesOut #SuperBowl
YESSSSSSSSS!!!! #GoPats #SuperBowl
Who's ref'ing this game John Moss? #SuperBowl
It's happening tonight! The next instalment of #Cloverfield is coming to @netflix after #SuperBowl! This is totally lit! #CloverfieldParadox https://t.co/baU8ywd7oZ
Still amazes me how abysmal some of the tackling is in the #NFL... #SuperBowl2018 #SuperBowl #SuperBowlLII
Everyone has to be watching BBC coverage of the super bowl rather than sky’s pish coverage
Been a good 1st half for a #SuperBowl usually don't get going until late on.
The kicker with the best tackle tonight 😂 #FlyEaglesFly #SuperBowl
Me dice aquí el notas que paso durante todo el año pero que todos los años en esta fecha señalada le doy por saco frente a la TV... obvio, es tradición!  Y tráeme otra cerveza!#SuperBowl
Cannot be a coincidence that both sides are missing field goals when Gareth Southgate is present at the game...

Is only watching super bowl for Justin 👀 I ain’t got a clue what’s going on 🙊
When your only job is to kick..... #gopatsgo #superbowl https://t.co/rIRmwFAT0R
I'm no American football expert, but I have seen Ace Ventura Pet Detective over 50 times and I know missing a kick from that distance is not good. #SuperBowl
Nunca había celebrado tanto en un partido de Football, debe ser el ambiente #SuperBowl
Have these kickers being on the Pablo Escobar or some shit 😂 #SBLII #Superbowl
Touchdown Patriots. #NotDone #SuperBowl #SBLII
That’s more like it from the Patriots 🤙🤙🤙 #SuperBowl
BEAUTIFUL!!! Great blocking, great run, huge drive right there! Momentum swinger. INT &amp; then the touchdown. 👍 #SuperBowl #SuperBowlLII #Patriots #GoPats #PatriotsNation #PatsNation #NFL #GoPats #NotDone
Brilliant play leading up to that TD by @Patriots #SuperBowlLII #SuperBowl

Sorry, can’t get the juices flowing for this rugby game, I’m off to bed #Superbowl
Come on #Eagles please don't fall apart like last year's #Falcons who should of won it #SuperBowl
Kicking is dreadful tonight #SuperBowl
Touchdown New England Refs. 
No flag for clear pass interference and invisible flags on 3rd down being  thrown for the Pats #CheatBowl #SuperBowl
How do guys get to this level without being able to tackle? White has just runs straight through three!! #SuperBowl
I don't know if it's the stadium, the overly corporate audience, or whatever, but the audio levels for a #SuperBowl are awful. Sounds like a preseason game.
Slam dunk? #superbowl #handegg
Proper ball game this 

#superbowl
White just peeled the defence apart! #SuperBowl #Patriots
TOUCHDOWN PATRIOTS!! Hey in there lads #SuperBowl #NotDone
Let’s go @Patriots #Superbowl
TOUCHDOWN NEW ENGLAND! #Patriots #SuperBowl
Touchdown Patriots! Woohoo #SuperBowl
Yes Pats! #superbowl #touchdown #brady #goat
Damn #FlyEaglesFly #SuperBowl
James superbowl white!! #GoPats
This is game is ridiculous so far, I'm loving it! #SuperBowl

Wow Brady is just amazing @SuperBowl #BBCnfl
If Tom Brady can drag the Patriots back into this game he will truly be the greatest quarterback of all time #SuperBowl
Don’t care about The Superbowl there’s a netflix original Cloverfield and  I’m going to cry
YEAAAAAAAASSSSS!!!!!! WHITE!!!! TOUCHDOWN!!!!!!!! 🚨🚨🚨🔥🔥🔥 #SuperBowl #SuperBowlLII #Patriots #GoPats #PatriotsNation #PatsNation #NFL #GoPats #NotDone
Just like that!!!! #NotDone #SuperBowl

#SuperBowl #notdone #patriots
Properly enjoying watching #SuperBowl this year... my one annual NFL game I tune into haha #BBCNFL
Wonder if they'll turn up in the second half. #patriots #SuperBowl #BBCNFL
So much less stressful when your team isn’t playing in the #SuperBowl How many points is too many at half time though? let’s go #Eagles let’s go!
Go Eagles ! I think I’m getting the hang of this at last #FlyEaglesFly #SuperBowlLII #SuperBowl
First time in as long as I can remember that I haven't watched the #superbowl on Sky; love those guys on #BBCNFL too much! @BBCSport
Here come the #patriots 12th man - damn refs  #SuperBowl

@PrincessBolade_ I’m watching super bowl.
Why the fuck is Gareth southgate on the panel for the super bowl ?? 😂🏈 #SuperBowlSunday
#BBCNFL 2nd quarter? Surely it’s 1st half? #OnlyInAmerica #Superbowl
F**k off was it holding. #superbowl
What’s more interesting to you? #superbowl #poll
That #Patriots mascot is terrifying #SuperBowl #BBCNFL
Love watching the superbowl no lie
Oh Fuck Off Refs #superbowl
Enjoying the #BBCNFL Super Bowl; chess with shoulder pads.
Hot dogs...nachos...beer...is it a lunch? Is it a picnic? No! It’s SuperBowl 52! Go Eagles! @SuperBowl #BBCNFL
It’s a shame the #FACup final doesn’t grab our nations attention like the #SuperBowl does in the USA
Wow what shape of bowl did they use for that haircut #BBCNFL no a super bowl anyway 🤣🤣
#BBCNFL @markchapman @JasonBell33 and @OsiUmenyiora are killing it so far, they've been great all season #SuperBowl
Gotta get Gronk in the game more. #SuperBowl #SuperBowlLII #Patriots #GoPats #PatriotsNation #PatsNation #NFL #GoPats #NotDone
So we're watching on the BBC which means no adverts. Apparently that's an important part of the superbowl experience. So feel free to try and sell me stuff in the breaks.
Thanks to Google I now act like I know about sports and stuff. Guess I should be supporting the #Eagles #SuperBowl https://t.co/XZTLZ9voq7

Great tip by Gilmore. Harmon finished the play. That could be big. Offense have to take advantage now. #SuperBowl #SuperBowlLII #Patriots #GoPats #PatriotsNation #PatsNation #NFL #GoPats #NotDone
Apparently, this game is going at a rare speed! #SuperBowl
That’s the one that’s going to hurt. #SuperBowl #FlyEaglesFly
And that's one of the luckiest takeaways I've seen! #SuperBowl
Eagles getting it DONE on 3rd down #SuperBowl
Might be the turning point. #SuperBowl
What is this owl everyone keeps tweeting about and why is it so superb? #superbowl 🦉 #bbcnfl
Let’s go now TB #SuperBowl
Jay Ajayi is killing it. #JayTrain #Superbowl #FlyEaglesFly
I'm a Brit. I know nothing about football. I chose to support the Eagles tonight based solely on Philly Cheese Steaks. 😂 #SuperBowl
Fantastic commentary by @gregbradyTO on @talkSPORT -Fantastic atmosphere palpable through the 📻 #SuperBowl https://t.co/odDZrKnLJb
Jesus Christ thought that was going for another tochdown and finally we get a break. MAN we needed that. #SuperBowl #SuperBowlLII #Patriots #GoPats #PatriotsNation #PatsNation #NFL #GoPats #NotDone

WHAT AN INTERCEPTION! Come on lads #SuperBowl #NotDone
Damm so Unlucky #superbowl
Interception! 👀 #SuperBowl
Watching the Super Bowl with some of the most amazing people I've ever been acquainted. Yoooooo!… https://t.co/YwMcP2TVyh
My GOD WE NEEDED THAT! #SuperBowl #SuperBowlLII #Patriots #GoPats #PatriotsNation #PatsNation #NFL #GoPats #NotDone
My reasons for not watching the Super Bowl:
1) Steelers aren't there
2) Pats are there
3) It's not ice hockey
4) The trophy is tiny 
5) Too many adverts
6) Stanley Cup Playoffs is the only thing that matter.
As a middle aged,middle class English person, I can’t believe how much I am hooked #SuperBowl

Gareth Southgate being used as a BBC pundit for #SuperBowl 😂 Thank god I’ve got Sky Sports 😂
Watching the Super Bowl for the first time. Not gunna lie I have no idea what's going on but they keep mentioning Tom Brady so I'm guessing he's important or something. 🤷‍♂️ #SuperBowl
How many copies of Tom Brady do the Patriots have? #BBCNFL #Superbowl
Actual futtage of me saying i will stay up for the super bowl @Paul_725 https://t.co/KPGSLzFiqu

Eagles defence has been immense so far. So much pressure #SuperBowl52 #SuperBowl
@AsToldByEddie bro, hull? Super Bowl?😩💔
Very cool. Love that it's releasing straight after the #SuperBowl https://t.co/9Kyb9CAF6l
Ok the #SuperBowl is good and everything...but where's my #Avengers Trailer!
Bad execution all around so far. We have to get Jefferey covered. O-Line gotta step up big time. And we need touchdowns. #SuperBowl #SuperBowlLII #Patriots #GoPats #PatriotsNation #PatsNation #NFL #GoPats #NotDone

#SuperBowl I wouldn't mind having #TomBrady on the ground.
If the #FlyEaglesFly go on to win tonight will Jay Ajayi become the first player to play in London and win the #superbowl in the same season? #BBCNFL #bbcsuperbowl #SuperBowlLII

I'm not sure that is how the Patriots drew that 3rd down play up in practice #SuperBowl
Down 2 touchdowns, main downfield threat off injured. Please forgive me if I don’t start counting any chickens just yet. This is just what Patriots do... #BBCNFL #SuperBowl
Watch the Super Bowl every year and still haven’t got a clue what the hell is happening.... 😂
Defense gotta make a stand again now. #SuperBowl #SuperBowlLII #Patriots #GoPats #PatriotsNation #PatsNation #NFL #GoPats #NotDone
The reason why I am gunning for the #eagles this #superbowl https://t.co/5ME9azy1Y8
Wow. Nobody in the US even remotely in passing likes the #Patriots. There is no love out there for them 😅😅. #SuperBowl
Offense keeps stalling. Protection keeps breaking down. Can’t keep breaking down and kicking field goals like this. Not good enough. #SuperBowl #SuperBowlLII #Patriots #GoPats #PatriotsNation #PatsNation #NFL #GoPats #NotDone
Majority of them are here just to drink and eat.  So I feel like they get the spirit of things. #superbowl
Well, the super bowl is dragged out. #SuperBowl2018

It’s that time of year again when I watch a bit of #SuperBowl and understand just a tiny bit about American Football, before inevitably falling asleep and forgetting it all again for another year. 🏈
Calling it now! Pats give up a ton of points then Brady sparks a miraculous comeback 😂 #SuperBowl  #Patriots #Pats #comeback
Any celeb want to bet that the Patriots don’t win the SuperBowl? I wouldn’t mind a date.. #SuperBowl #PHIvsNE #SB52 #SBLII

@LG_Blount covers a lot of ground and runs right to the end zone to give the @Eagles another 6pts!! What a play!! What a game!! #SuperBowl #SuperBowlLII @bbcnfl @NFL
So much for not celebrating when you score against your former club #Superbowl
@Joe_Gatto This is why I hate watching the SuperBowl in the UK - we don’t get the ads!
Watched four times already. Forgot the #superbowl was even still on. https://t.co/IzXumtY25t
Trying to follow the #SuperBowl Drive Chart whilst getting my eldest back to sleep, and I couldn’t help but notice THAT #BurgerMenu design on the @FOXSports website. Seriously, I’ve seen it all now. Let’s just leave it to @adidas to rock those three lines now, shall we? #UX https://t.co/9fjuKmPefz
Been too busy to watch the superbowl only just tuned in 😣😣😣
Il #SuperBowl è la cosa più spettacolare del mondo e io non posso  guardarlo 😭
2 point conversion missed though the only good thing. #SuperBowl #SuperBowlLII #Patriots #GoPats #PatriotsNation #PatsNation #NFL #GoPats #NotDone
@NTMTopa @piprufus1 @Gracie05272013 @MrSebBT @LynnieYankee @Topa_the_BT Can I just remind pats fan. Two weeks ago AFC conference final, superbowl last year it could be worse
Shove your super bowl up your ass
The Pats defence are not managing to second guess the Eagles offence.
#NoCheating
#BBCNFL 
#SuperBowl
Eagles chasing points early is a mistake, kick the PAT...
#SuperBowl
Love it! Another Eagles Touchdown! Go Philadelphia! #Eagles #SuperBowlLII #SuperBowl #SmashMouthFootball
Has Genie Bouchard agreed to go on a date with anyone yet? #SuperBowl
How do they ever finish a game? It stops every other minute, no clue whats happening 🤔 #SuperBowl
The Eagles are on fire at the minute #SuperBowl
Super Bowl🏈! Be nice to see someone else win it for a change! Come on @Eagles 🏈 #SuperBowl #NFL
Me trying to work out, what the hell #SuperBowl all about. Why is it such a big thing in #England all of a sudden. https://t.co/JZoPqSkDlx
Patriots are being demolished right now #SuperBowl - surely they can’t repeat last year again!
Deja Vu... #SuperBowl #Patriots
Patriots all over the place right now on both sides of the ball. Offense needs to do something now and quickly. #SuperBowl #SuperBowlLII #Patriots #GoPats #PatriotsNation #PatsNation #NFL #GoPats #NotDone
Who else is getting déjà vu from last year 🤔🤔🤔 #SuperBowl
Lets be honest, if anyone can bring it back its the Pats #Superbowl
After last year it’s hard to get excited about the Eagles being 2 TD’s up against the pats!!! #SuperBowl
All #Eagles so far in the 2nd! #FlyEaglesFly #SuperBowl
Donald Trump needs to have a chat with his boys at half time cos they’re flopping hard right now #SuperBowl
Shift done 🙌 Superbowl Time 🏈 #SBLII
¿Que si hay fans de Los #Eagles aqui? #SuperBowl https://t.co/KA1f8VdfCC
This is easily the best #SuperBowl I’ve seen
Blake Bortles has never missed a 2 point attempt in a Super Bowl @BortlesFacts
Eagles! #SuperBowl https://t.co/TQnt1B68Hh
I’m in London, regrettably at @PlanetHollywood, people are chanting “fuck you tom Brady” I’m into it #SuperBowl
If Scotland had 3 shots at trying to get forward 10yrds last night we MIGHT not have got absolutely pumped by Wales. #sixnations2018 #WALvSCO #SuperBowl
Man I love the #SuperBowl come on #Philly
Netflix just changed film distribution with a Superbowl Trailer. Fair.
Can never beat @ladygaga’s #SuperBowl halftime show performance!
No TD #Superbowl
That’s Numberwang! #superbowl #handegg
I just cannot enjoy this #Superbowl
WHAT A TD #SuperBowl
After the Jags’ last ten years, I am so conditioned to watching the Super Bowl in awe at seeing competent football. This year, I’m not seeing much that the Jags can’t do. Makes a refreshing change.

Honestly can Madonna do the Super Bowl again next year, there's enough iconic tracks for her to do like...2 more without repeating herself.

Super Bowl could be quite good if I had any idea wtf the rules were!
Here we go ..same old same old #SuperBowl
And so it begins? #SuperBowl
What was said to Gronk and Gostkowski during that ht teamtalk! Completely different players this half! #NotDone #GoPats #SuperBowlLII #SuperBowl
Credit to the Pats, that's so typical - Brady and Gronk terrible. Until suddenly they are not and put themselves back into the game. Two amazing players #SuperBowl
180? #SuperBowl #handegg
Brady / Gronkowski TD #SuperBowl #superbowl2018 #Patriots
Here we go. So predictable. Come on Eagles. #SuperBowl
MUCH BETTER!!! 3 point game!!! DEFENSE YOUR UP NOW DON’T LET US DOWN!!! #SuperBowl  #SuperBowlLII #Patriots #GoPats  #PatriotsNation #PatsNation #NFL #GoPats  #NotDone
First ever super bowl. I mean I'm English, but i love "Always Sunny in Philadelphia". So how do i choose? 🤔
Easy as that. #Touchdown #Patriots #SuperBowl
TOUCHDOWN!!! @Patriots #Patriots #SuperBowl #SBLII #PHIvsNE https://t.co/DuHWsaaxCv

That 50 foot tall Prince in the Halftime Show was pretty decent. #Superbowl
Update from the Super Bowl party... #SBLII https://t.co/rD2tuDpZ2v
That’s brilliant from the Eagles. #Superbowl
Here we go, we’re all about to get Bradied. #SuperBowl
Gronk Gronking #SuperBowl
All ready for the show! Lined up for one of the most important sports events of the year... the super bowl is coming! I can't believe I only discovered this sport this year. What a brilliant game ...
Anybody who believes that Tom and The Patriots are out of it, 1) didn't see the championship game recently against the jags, and 2) didn't watch last year's Super Bowl!! #GoPats #SBLII #BoldNorth

"25 out of 25 throws, Brady catches that, but not this time." Americans aren't that stupid, are they? #SuperBowlSunday #SuperBowlLII #SuperBowl52 #SuperBowl #SuperBowl2018
#SuperBowl it's been a really good game so far. Feels like Philadelphia Eagles will win today but anything can happen when it comes to the patriots.
Im sure that #PepsiHalftime show was good, if the pub hadnt muted half of it 🤔 #SuperBowl #JustinTimberlake
Must convert. Must convert. Must convert. #SuperBowl  #SuperBowlLII #Patriots #GoPats  #PatriotsNation #PatsNation #NFL #GoPats  #NotDone
Come on Eagles don’t let them in straight away #SuperBowl
Great Show! #SBLII #SB52   #JustinTimberlake  #SuperBowl
I'm glad I'm not one of the fans that watches the Super Bowl just for the halftime show. I'd be gutted if I'd watched the first half just for that drab shite
Quite pleased that my 4 predictions for the #superbowl halftime show actually happened! Knew JT better than I thought
Oh shit Gronk is awake #SuperBowl #eagles #patriots
Justin Timberlake my thoughts #HalftimeShow #SuperBowl https://t.co/mG2fThXjat
Can’t stall now fellas! We need 7 points here no excuses!!! #SuperBowl  #SuperBowlLII #Patriots #GoPats  #PatriotsNation #PatsNation #NFL #GoPats  #NotDone
Second half under way New England have to come back from a double point deficit in a Super Bowl yet again #SBL11
it doesn't matter what the outcome of the #SuperBowl is, the real winner is friendship.
Halftime show at #SuperBowl Should've gone and made coffee, not quite as boring as JT
Well after #SuperBowl gonna Get Watching @DCAwrestling Proving Grounds Pre Show And Well Predictions As Well Tonight Long night Also Nadi Comments 🔥🔥🔥 And I got Bit Of it As Well. Anyway On with the 2nd Half Of The Bowl

Halftime show over with now to try and watch the rest without snoozing...that won’t happen though I’ll end up taking a snooze and catching the end #SuperBowl
Remember when Sean Payton chose to kick an onside kick to start the half of the 2009 super bowl? Wild
Better. Better. Gronk catch 👍 #SuperBowl  #SuperBowlLII #Patriots #GoPats  #PatriotsNation #PatsNation #NFL #GoPats  #NotDone
Great so far, excellent from The Eagles and Josh Norman on Sky is 👌🏻 #SuperBowl

The @BrunoMars Superbowl 48 halftime show is still my favourite half time show I've watched.
I so badly want #Eagles to do this. #Superbowl
Staying up to watch the superbowl; sleep who needs it #me
Eagles to win by 6 #myprediction #SuperBowl
@DHudson93 why? Watch the Super Bowl

I enjoyed it but I think I sang more words than JT 😂 watching my first ever super bowl #gettingeducated #superbowl2018 https://t.co/CSmVtG3t9a
It was either that half time nonsense or @BabestationTV nothing else on so I’m sure everyone is feeling refreshed for the 2nd half #SuperBowl
You go #JustinTimberlake you still got those moves!!✌ amazing half time show!! #ijustwantedtodance #SuperBowl
@nidlpgeek Noooo don’t use someone who absolutely stole the show at Super Bowl to promote yourself! Watch the prince Super Bowl show and tell me if Justin Timberlake was good....or watch gaga and tell me if that was good 😴😴😴
GUYS, do you remember that beyonce and pepsi super bowl ad where she was in a dance studio full of mirrors and with each reflection, she reincarnated all the looks and dance moves from her previous hits? BEST AD EVER
#JTimberlake at the #SuperBowl is just off the chain - fantastic performance @jtimberlake
I loved that half time show till the last song. Love #Timberlake but Sunshine in my pocket sounds like it was written on a spreadsheet by an account using a summer hit algorithm. #souless #SuperBowl #HalftimeShow
Well that was disappointing #SuperBowl #JustinTimberlake @jtimberlake
Justin Timberlake is a great performer #SuperBowl
Will this montage ever end? #BBCSuperBowl #SuperBowl
Shout out to the lad in the super bowl half time show who legit couldn't give a shit and was only there cause he knew it'd get him some top notch twitter game
#superbowl https://t.co/t6CQXDCvxs
So that’s the worst half time show I’ve seen, and the Patriots are losing 😢 at least we have beer and chicken wings plus the hope that Tom Brady aka the GOAT can still pull this off!! #superbowl #miming #BBCNFL
#HalfTimeShow feat @jtimberlake was fucking wank #TimeToRetire #Miming #SuperBowl #SuperBowl2018 #SBLII #BBCNFL
Superbowl 52 will go down in the annuls as the year the half time show mimed his way through #JustinTimberlake
What happened to all the commercials? #BBCNFL #SuperBowlAds #SuperBowlLII #SuperBowl
Justin Timberlake tho💜 #SuperBowl
@jtimberlake was good but could have done with some tits to be honest! #SuperBowl #SBLII #wherewasjanet
HAPPY #SUPERBOWL https://t.co/ZqH2qcleLT
Justin Timberlake wasn't as good as that guy winging it in the shark costume a couple of years back by the way #SuperBowl
The fact that JT didn’t close with “Dick in a Box”, feat. a surprise appearance from Lady GaGa and The Lonely Island, deeply upsets me. #SuperBowl https://t.co/HFzV1IRGas
#JustinTimberlake just smashed the #PepsiHalftime show at #SuperBowl Go @jtimberlake  Loved it!👊
No special guests? Have a word. I was banking on Big Shaq to break out 'Mans Not Hot'. Gutted. #SuperBowl #PepsiHalftime
How long is the half time break!? #SuperBowl
But Britney next year doing a 12 minute mix of 'Gimme More'? Yes please. #SuperBowl
That was the best half time show in years- well done JT &amp; crew! Amazing!! #SuperBowl
He might have brought #sexyback but #JustinTimberlake didn’t deliver! Bring back #LadyGaga #SuperBowl #SBLII
@RossWilliams_ Nick Foles just caught a TD on 4th down in the Super Bowl against the Patriots, have some respect
#JustinTimberlake has killed it in the #Superbowl #HalftimeShow #NFL
Two games played on the EU server during the super bowl half time. Both had 90% tier 10 Tanks. @WoTConsole @RAIBot01 fix matchmaking that is ridiculous for a “balanced” system #WorldOfTanks
Very excited to see just how the Patriots come back from this. Pencilled down Hogan to make the outrageous catch this year. #SuperBowl #BBCNFL
Forget Brady.... #JustinTimberlake = GOAT #superbowl
Yes yes yes @jtimberlake !! Killed it 🔥💯 #PepsiHalftime #SuperBowl
Remember #PatriotsNation 28-3 #NotDone #GoPats #SuperBowl
@jtimberlake what a true showman and entertainer! One of the best of my generation for sure! #SuperBowlLII #justintimberlake #prince #superbowl https://t.co/LB3Svcqe3E
So it’s half time of the #SuperBowl and neither QB has been sacked yet... but Thomas Christensen has! #lufc
Don't involve Prince in your boring halftime show, Justin, c'mon man #SuperBowl
I will accept no Justin Timberlake slander today. None whatsoever. #superbowl
Best part of the show #SuperBowl https://t.co/EiWWE2DcWQ

Won £35 already on Super Bowl, thanks JT💕💕💕
Didn’t stay up this late for no #NSync   #SuperBowl #HalftimeShow https://t.co/fscr94RTes
And after that performance, Justin Timberlake is still most famous for getting Janet Jackson's norks out during #SuperBowl half time.
I think Timberlake smashed the half time show. Super bowl 52 🏈😊
@jtimberlake totally rocked half time  #SuperBowl @mondobrewing
Justin we can’t hear you! #PepsiHalftime #SuperBowlLII #superbowl
Right come on let’s get the game back on!! Let’s roll #Pats 🏈 #SuperBowl
This is definitely a first! I’m still awake watching the super bowl!
#SuperBowl #HalftimeShow. What just happened? https://t.co/RvEDwYHHXF
If you have 4 minutes free at Super Bowl halftime. Maybe a good time to see a great Ireland France rugby ending. https://t.co/OleWrhZHBn
If the internet could get to work and get us all the gif of that poor awkward kid who was forced to dance / take selfies with JT for what felt like eternity that would be most helpful. #BBCNFL #SuperBowl
Hey @NFL and @NBCSports, this is what we know in the UK as "Test Card F." It is better than #PepsiHalftime at #SuperBowl this year. #HalfTime #HalfTimeShow https://t.co/dwgr8wsFs7
Best #SuperBowl halftime show since 2002 which was U2's 9/11 tribute. That may never be bettered.
#HalftimeShow
#SuperBowl #NFL #Minneapolis #HalftimeShow #JustinTimberlake #Prince #YES 👌🏻👏🏻🌟💥 Shout out to the boy in the crowd JT was dancing next to! How fun! #selfie 🤳🏻
@SuperBowl I like that your saving the budget for @rihanna to headline next year #HalftimeShow
No NSYNC reunion, 4/10 #SuperBowl
@luberachi Very disppointing for a Superbowl. It's an honour for most people but I guess this is his what, third time appearing at halftime..? First solo
Lo que no me gustó que escogieran a JT fue que el mae está promocionando álbum, que acaba de salir, literal iba a eso y por eso el inicio fue ralo #superbowl
#SuperBowl should just have @BrunoMars and @Beyonce do the halftime show each year
#EpicFail the young lad ‘dancing’ with @jtimberlake at the #Superbowl #HalftimeShow. Started tweeting his selfie before the camera had even moved on! 😂#PlasticFan
JT just absolutely killed it #HalftimeShow #SuperBowl
And Well refilling On Pop some sweets Haribo Tangtastics And Well It’s 2nd Half time #SuperBowl
@jtimberlake smashed super bowl half time #SuperBowl52 ✨🕺🏻
#BBCNFL Justin timberlake totally bossed it. Grinning from ear to ear #SuperBowl

BREAKING: I’ve made it to the 3rd Quarter... New personal best 💪 #superbowl
Well that has nailed the shittest #SuperBowl half time show in years
WOW loved that!!! Only in the Super Bowl

Superb show from JT!!! This 2nd half is gonna be something else now if 1st half was anything to go buy..... brady to get it done pats win by 3 #SuperBowl
#superbowl 
#gopats
LETS GOOOOOO
You feel that halftime show would have been one of the greats if Timberlake just had more good songs #SuperBowl
You’re stood next to JT at the super bowl during the half time show...get off your phone boy! #BBCNFL
.@jtimberlake THAT. WAS. EPIC. 👏👏👏 #superbowl
Wondering whether @bhamtailors will be selling @jtimberlake's jacket/trousers/suit in the morning? #SuperBowl
#JustinTimberlake 👏 #SuperBowl
What a performance 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 @jtimberlake #SuperBowl halftime #SuperBowl2018 #SuperBowl
Not gunna lie...bit disappointing that NSync didn’t parachute in through the roof like the Bye Bye Bye video. 😂🙈 #SuperBowl #SuperBowlHalftimeShow #HalftimeShow
Plenty of hits but pretty dull. Even the #Prince tribute just used Prince vocals over Justin Timberlake part playing piano 🙄#PepsiHalftime #superbowl
I think the nicest thing I can say about that is, instantly forgettable #SuperBowl #HalftimeShow
Forget the Super Bowl for a sec...it’s snowing 🌨
@liamgallagher @NoelGallagher an @oasis reunion @ next years SuperBowl LIII would be worth a watch #SuperBowl
Worst halftime show ever! #SuperBowl https://t.co/t1eTrDwJJr
WHERE THE HELL WAS NSYNC #SuperBowl
Let’s get this second half underway then, come on @Patriots let’s go. @SuperBowl
BBC couldn't afford a room with lights. That's $20 extra. #SuperBowl
Oh that wasn't on long 😯 #JustinTimberlake #SuperBowlSunday #SuperBowl Good job we taped the half-time show for @emcharlie13
Brill halftime performance from JT. I was half hoping he’d reunite with his old NSYNC pals, just one last time though! #SuperBowl
It’s 1:30 in London, stayed up to watch the super bowl even though I have a 5am wake up, and that’s all you could give JT... pathetic
JT. Killed it. #SuperBowl #CoolestManOnThePlanet
@jtimberlake you legend!!!! 😍😍😍🙌🏻🙌🏻😍🎤🏈 #superbowl
So many tunes! @jtimberlake #JT #SBLII #SuperBowl
Justin Timberlake just absolutely destroyedddddd the #superbowl #HalftimeShow #JustinTimberlake 🔥🙌🏼
Would rather just keep watching Justin than the Super Bowl tbh🤷🏽‍♀️
Didn’t think much of half time show #SuperBowl
Has that kid who just selfie-d with JT become #LeftShark #SuperBowl #HalftimeShow
Halftime Show: a trip through Justin Timberlake's Spotify playlist controlled by a hyperactive child on Red Bull #SuperBowl
Looking forward to the Super Bowl next year, with cardi b on the half time show 🙂
Maybe it's been too long since Justin has performed cos compared to Beyonce and Bruno Mars that was average and I love Justin. #SuperBowl
Thank fuck for that. Now where is Thanos?! #AvengersInfinityWar #InfinityWar #SuperBowl
That was a great #SuperBowl half time show. Top Notch Justin #Timberlake.
Half time show needed to be more Prince and less Timberlake #SuperBowl
Can’t wait for the Timberlake crowd memes to come out 👀 #superbowl #JustinTimberlake
That was seriously poor I'm glad it's over #JustinTimberlake #SuperBowl #HalftimeShow
Probably the best #superbowl #HalftimeShow I have seen!
Good call #SuperBowl
Yes Yes yes Get In There Massive 2 points here #superbowl
The catch rule is singlehandedly trying to destroy football. No way that shouldn't be a TD. But the rule is nonsense just now (as we can testify to @steelers) #SuperBowl
Ok we need a touchdown to win this game now. #SuperBowl  #SuperBowlLII #Patriots #GoPats  #PatriotsNation #PatsNation #NFL #GoPats  #NotDone
This rule is bullshit. That’s a catch all day long #eagles #Superbowl
@Patriots getting a decision again?😂 #SuperBowl
the eagles just won the super bowl😩
He is a Runner As well #superbowl
If that’s a touchdown then Steelers should’ve had their allowed against Patriots earlier this season. #SBLII #SuperBowl
Deff a touchdown that #SuperBowl
How can you have rules that no one understands 🤷‍♂️ #SuperBowl
Come on boys......that's a TD.
#SuperBowl
Fuck I wouldn't want be the guy to review this #SuperBowl

Got to be A Td otherwise Robbery! Sorry but gotta be a Td #superbowl
I hate when artists play slow songs at the #SuperBowl but I'm quite happy with 'Everytime' by Britney Spears or 'All That' by Carly Rae Jepsen
Here we go again! Catch, no catch who the hell knows? #SuperBowl
He is Cleary Running As Well #superbowl
Catch or not a catch ... part2?!? #SuperBowl
That better be a Td otherwise Fuck these refs #superbowl
Eagles proper grind their offences for ages, in this instance it could win em the Super Bowl if there’s not enough time for the Patriots riposte
@bradigor A UK born player scoring in a Super Bowl would be a massive deal in mainstream media
It's a try #SuperBowl
If Jesse James touchdown against us didn’t stand there’s no way this can #SuperBowl
Yep. That's a touchdown #SuperBowl
🙌 #Superbowl https://t.co/3Vb8v66TbV
TOUCHDOWN!!!!! @Eagles @SuperBowl #SuperBowl #SBLII #FlyEaglesFly https://t.co/DRqvTOMxng
What if Tom Brady is a unit of time? #BBCNFL #Superbowl
That should not stand. #SuperBowl  #SuperBowlLII #Patriots #GoPats  #PatriotsNation #PatsNation #NFL #GoPats  #NotDone
Tense finish coming up at the #SuperBowl
Zac Eartz #superbowl Td for me
DON’T YOU DARE!!! #SuperBowl
Oooh this is getting tense #SuperBowl
@A_Nuur7 Watch the super bowl
Did I just hear that correctly from Collingsworth 'This game is just as good as Timberlake' jeeze 😷 #SuperBowl
2:30 left in the fourth quarter. 1 point in it. It’s going to come down to the last play and we’ll all cry #superbowl
Foles is my Super Bowl MVP #SBLII
Interception defense come on!!! #SuperBowl  #SuperBowlLII #Patriots #GoPats  #PatriotsNation #PatsNation #NFL #GoPats  #NotDone
#bbcnfl best #SuperBowl I have seen and by the way the BBC coverage has been exceptional has converted me from sky
1081 total yards so far.....wow!
Some game. Nick Foles is having some game.......
Come on Philly!
#SuperBowl
Need to go to bed.. am up at 6.30. Super Bowl LII too good and too close to ignore.
What on earth!? I close my eyes for a minute and Patriots come back 32-33. When did that happen!? Come on now, #FlyEaglesFly #SuperBowl 🏈
I thought the Super Bowl half time show was average #JustinTimberlake
Suddenly we're in "Don't score too quickly" territory #SuperBowl
This Superbowl is going to be a classic
The windows @NickFoles_9 has been throwing into tonight have been breathtaking, and consistently amazing. What a season, what a Superbowl- most yardage of any post season game,let alone a Superbowl. #SuperBowl
Jeeezzz. #Superbowl https://t.co/Q3Y2GDWAc6
Help mawr i Foles bod Nelson Agholor wedi cael stormar ‘fyd! #Eagles #SuperBowl https://t.co/wCH7j8J8ky
What a great SUPERBOWL 🇺🇸🏈
Agholor has been clutch tonight for #Eagles ! #SuperBowl
Damn why can’t watching a Super Bowl be relaxing for a Pats fan #GoPats #NotDone
Please defense. One big play. Force the fumble, interception. Please. #SuperBowl  #SuperBowlLII #Patriots #GoPats  #PatriotsNation #PatsNation #NFL #GoPats  #NotDone
This feels like the quickest Super Bowl since the 1990s at least #SBLII
Make the stop. Make the stop. #SuperBowl  #SuperBowlLII #Patriots #GoPats  #PatriotsNation #PatsNation #NFL #GoPats  #NotDone
What a Throw by Foles #SuperBowl
Deep in the 4th quarter and quarterbacks have been receivers (2) more times than there have been punts (1). This is so good #SuperBowl #SBLII
@#BBCNFL best super bowl worse half time show #squeekybumtime
Glad I got up for this! Love an exciting game! #SuperBowl
Need a huge play here defense. Huge play defense play please. #SuperBowl  #SuperBowlLII #Patriots #GoPats  #PatriotsNation #PatsNation #NFL #GoPats  #NotDone
So … Super Bowl. Fourth quarter. Patriots take the lead. Some things don't change! #BBCNFL
Flipped to see what the SuperBowl is doing, and that score is tight!
The most random people on my snapchat are watching Super Bowl right now.

Shitting myself #FlyEaglesFly #SuperBowl
What a Crazy game this is #SuperBowl
This is one of the best Super Bowls ever and this crowd noise absolutely sucks. It's virtually quiet! Are they frozen? #SuperBowl
This and the last #Superbowl have been fantastic adverts for the NFL around the world. Epic games!
Whatever happens  this is beenn a superb  game #SuperBowl #Eagles #Patriots
Can't even less than 5 mins 1 point in it #SuperBowl #BBCNFL
Ballsy call number 2 = thriller #SuperBowl #Eagles
Having watched every Super Bowl since John Riggins smashed the Dolphins and being a big fan of the NFC this is without doubt the best I’ve seen #bbcnfl
#SuperBowl #NotDone https://t.co/kHA7rZBYiC
I tell you what, if you want an exciting Super Bowl, out that Patriots in it! This is epic #SuperBowl
These teams are playing 4th downs like it was a game of Madden. I love it. #superbowl
Been a fantastic #SuperBowl so far, two great offences #SBLII #Eagles #Patriots
Need a sack. Need a stop. Need a sack. Need a stop. Come on defense do your job. #SuperBowl  #SuperBowlLII #Patriots #GoPats  #PatriotsNation #PatsNation #NFL #GoPats  #NotDone
It’s now or never for the Eagles. They don’t want to get off the field here without scoring and allow Brady to win it for the Patriots #SB52 #SuperBowl
Just cos the # is cool 😎 #SuperBowl
This is the greatest Superbowl ever
This Justin Timberlake superbowl performance is so dead 😔
Just need to stop the touchdown here that’s all we need. #SuperBowl  #SuperBowlLII #Patriots #GoPats  #PatriotsNation #PatsNation #NFL #GoPats  #NotDone
Gutsy call. Gutsy play. #SBLII #superbowl
Standard Patriots 4th quarter come from behind to win? #Patriots #SuperBowl
Same time next year Super Bowl, yeah?🏈🏈🤙 @SkyBet https://t.co/MgXL7xIIDy
Throw by Foles! #SuperBowl
Need a sack. Need a sack. Need a sack. #SuperBowl  #SuperBowlLII #Patriots #GoPats  #PatriotsNation #PatsNation #NFL #GoPats  #NotDone
Honestly question how Gronk got through university. Just look at him. You know the lights are on, but nobody’s home... #superbowl https://t.co/PI99qjA0EY
That was Clutch #SuperBowl
Playing football is the way Tom Brady funds the most important thing to him - the quest for eternal life #superbowl
God damn it. #SuperBowl  #SuperBowlLII #Patriots #GoPats  #PatriotsNation #PatsNation #NFL #GoPats  #NotDone
YES!!! MCCOURTY!!! Harrison came up huge there recognising the play. #SuperBowl  #SuperBowlLII #Patriots #GoPats  #PatriotsNation #PatsNation #NFL #GoPats  #NotDone
Going to, rightly, be a lot of attention on Nick Foles and Tom Brady tonight - but I just made the best chicken wings of my life, so I think we’ve all got something to be proud of #superbowl

I don't like the #Pats, but dear goodness I respect them. When they get into their groove they are incredible on both defense and offense. Top class football. #SuperBowl
Another big play. #SuperBowl  #SuperBowlLII #Patriots #GoPats  #PatriotsNation #PatsNation #NFL #GoPats  #NotDone
Come on the patriots! Superbowl 52 🏈👍😊
Anytime you want, either of you can play some defence if you really want,  just saying #SuperBowl
Brady's hands so important he can't even hold his own water bottle on the sidelines 😂

#SuperBowl #Patriots
Good stuff. #SuperBowl  #SuperBowlLII #Patriots #GoPats  #PatriotsNation #PatsNation #NFL #GoPats  #NotDone

That Eli Manning and @OBJ_3  tv spot just became favourite thing of 2018! #GiantsPride #SuperBowlLII #EliandOdell #SuperBowl
What a super bowl though, an attacking, exciting game 👏 #SuperBowl
For the folks that watch the #SuperBowl in the UK, is it not enough we have to stay up all night to watch it. We don’t even get to watch those million dollar ads 😩
YES @RobGronkowski 💪🏻🔥🏈🎊#SuperBowl @GreenwoodLDN https://t.co/auhPt9poOf
Big play here. #SuperBowl  #SuperBowlLII #Patriots #GoPats  #PatriotsNation #PatsNation #NFL #GoPats  #NotDone
No matter what happens now this surely has to go down has the greatest #SuperBowl in history #PatsvsEagles
Good job Rowe. #SuperBowl  #SuperBowlLII #Patriots #GoPats  #PatriotsNation #PatsNation #NFL #GoPats  #NotDone
Going into the last 10 minutes and I still have no idea who’s going to win this ball game! 🏈 #SuperBowl #SuperBowlLII #SBLII
Right @Eagles , time to give it to Jay Ajayi so he can show how Brits are better at this Rugby thing.. #SuperBowl #FlyEaglesFly
10 minutes to go. #Patriots finally leading. Nerves starting to emerge.

#SuperBowl
Thank you @nflukhank for bringing @ChrisWesseling @DanHanzus @greggrosenthal &amp; @MarcSesslerNFL to our TV screens @NFLUK #SuperBowl @AroundTheNFL
Ooh I wonder how this game will finish. iPlayer keeps breaking, Patriots go ahead in the fourth quarter, these are bad signs #Superbowl
I know Belichick is supposed to be some kind of coaching genius but the current tactics of “throw it to the big lad” are kind of obvious. #SuperBowl
Exactly.... 😴... boring......
#SuperBowl #DontCare https://t.co/kfUSJGTHfa
What a amazing #SuperBowl I have ever seen #bbcnfl #BBCSuperBowl. Come on #Patriots #PatriotsEagles
DO YOUR JOB DEFENSE!!! #SuperBowl  #SuperBowlLII #Patriots #GoPats  #PatriotsNation #PatsNation #NFL #GoPats  #NotDone
Patriots take the lead 33-32 in the #SuperBowl with under 10 minutes to play. This is going to be close! 🏈  

#SuperBowl52 #SBLII https://t.co/NzAqVxBx9J
Never write the Patriots off 🤙#Patriots #SuperBowl
Come on Patriots = 33-32 Up now #SuperBowl
If I'm correct this the first time the #Eagles have been behind, be interesting to see how they react to that pressure #SuperBowl #PatsvsEagles
What a catch! #Gronk #SuperBowl 👏🏼🏈 https://t.co/1Tsi3p5r7y
Cheers @SkyBet #flashboost #Super Bowl https://t.co/hwXMhmuors
Will Tom Brady and co (New England Patriots) retain their title in Minneapolis, or will the Philadelphia Eagles land their first Super Bowl? One stop or one drive is the difference in one of the best Super Bowls in years! The pace and heights of some of these throws is awesome.
What if Tom Brady suddenly contracted meningitis? #BBCNFL #Superbowl
🏈🏈🏈 TOUCHDOWN 🏈🏈🏈
@TomFcknBrady passes to @RobGronkowski to put the @Patriots 1pt in the lead 33-32!! This is incredible!! Best game of American football I have ever seen!!! 😊🏈👍🏻
@Eagles need to change it up and rethink their strategy!!
#SuperBowl #SuperBowlLII #BBCNFL
If I was a neutral this game would be great to watch. As a Patriots fan, like the last few #SuperBowl, this is very tense. #NotDone
GRONK OR SCOTTY T?

#SuperBowl https://t.co/qlo54AeGkW
So a college football game has broken out in the #SuperBowl #BBCNFL @richeisen
This is fucking great game, eagles defence need that turnover/interception 🙏 to change the tide #SuperBowl #flyeaglesfly
Oh shit! #Patriots take the lead! 👀 #Eagles #SuperBowl #SuperBowlLII
#bbcsport  nice to see the forest flag at the super bowl. Xxx
Watching the super bowl and I have no idea what is going on #SuperBowl52
Hate Gronk sooo much! #superbowl
#Patriots take the lead. Come on #eagles you can still win this #SuperBowl
What. A. Game. #SuperBowl #SB52
What did I say urghhh #SuperBowl
Patriots looking good now... #SuperBowl
Well well Brady to Gronkowski! I'm pretty sure I've heard that before! 33-32 #Patriots what a game #SuperBowl
Defense needs a massive, massive play on this drive now! Make it happen fellas. Do your job. Do your job. Do your job. #SuperBowl  #SuperBowlLII #Patriots #GoPats  #PatriotsNation #PatsNation #NFL #GoPats  #NotDone
Game On!!!!!!!!! @Pats_Superbowl #SuperBowl
I feel like I might have seen this movie before... #SuperBowl
Patriots take the lead in the fourth quarter...kind of predictable that #superbowl
This Super Bowl is insane! 1000+ yards and still 9 mins left! @NatCoombs #SuperBowl52
This has got a sickeningly familiar look about it 🙄 #SuperBowl
Hate the Pats sooo much #superbowl
The #bbcnfl commentary in place of @SuperBowl commercials is giving me more anxiety than I can handle... and give those guys some chairs!! #bbcsuperbowl 
#superbowl  #SBLII
I can't eye roll this game enough. 🙄 #SuperBowl
Well shit. Now I have to watch the entire game. #superbowl
Could go either way! #SBLII #SuperBowl
The #Eagles out here playing like they in the Philly streets 🤣🤣🤣 throwing themselves at the opponent and come out limping but triumphant #SuperBowl
The #JayTrain is raging #superbowl

@Patriots are moving ominously now - @Eagles can't touch them defensively once they get going. This is how they have won so many Superbowls. Impressive #SuperBowl
I just love the SuperBowl 😝 #SBLII
I love Danny Amendola!!! #SuperBowl  #SuperBowlLII #Patriots #GoPats  #PatriotsNation #PatsNation #NFL #GoPats  #NotDone
Regardless of whether he wins tonight, what happens to Nick Foles next season? Does Carson Wentz walk back into the team when he is fit? #BBCNFL #bbcsuperbowl #SuperBowl #HandEggFinal

This #SuperBowl is crazy, end to end,  high scores, big passes, this is like if the NFL was a Rocky movie.
@ATLienPierce they’re just having fun with it smh, imagine not beating Tom Brady in a super bowl
That old fella in the stands is the only person in the stadium older than Tom Brady #SuperBowl
@SonequaMG I'm loving you as well. But not this episode. Not until the end of this game anyway...#SuperBowl
Best Superbowl since saints won 2009 Superbowl! Still 1 quarter to go 😐😐😐👍
This drive is huge now. Monumentally huge. Let’s build on that defensive stand now. Come on G.O.A.T let’s go! #SuperBowl  #SuperBowlLII #Patriots #GoPats  #PatriotsNation #PatsNation #NFL #GoPats  #NotDone

America's getting Star Wars n Jurassic World #SuperBowl ads. Meanwhile the UK just saw our 9th TV spot for Den of Thieves starring 50 Cent n Gerard Butler...
New England have played the most dramatic ever Superbowl bs NY, most ridiculous ever Superbowl vs ATL &amp; most inexplicable ever Superbowl vs SEA. Now gunning for most entertaining ever vs PHI? #BBCNFLshow
I must be on my own, but just td, td, td with no drama or incident, is so boring! #BBCNFL #SuperBowl #EaglesvsPatriots
Good quarter, excellent #SuperBowl so far 🏈
Got a feeling this game will be decided by a walk-off 99-yard punt return by Malcolm Butler #SBLII #Superbowl
I want John Williams to do the next Super Bowl half time show. Open up with the ‘Jaws’ theme. 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻

#SuperBowlLll #Eagles 
#SuperBowlHalftime
Still no Butler I can’t believe this. What could he have possibly done? #SuperBowl  #SuperBowlLII #Patriots #GoPats  #PatriotsNation #PatsNation #NFL #GoPats  #NotDone
I need some more NFL bad lip readings after this game #superbowl
3 quarters in the books and we've got a real barn-burner in Minneapolis #SuperBowl
Tomorrow morning negotiations will restart about when my wife will allow my daughter to first stay up for a Super Bowl. I watched first quarter of SBXIX when I was 6…
Intense 4th quarter ahead!! Really enjoyed this game 😄 #SuperBowl
I’m wearing a camo jacket. Justin Timberlake is wearing a camo jacket. What can I say...our outfits are *NSYNC 😏😂 #SuperBowl
Just when you think you've got the hang of the rules, a touchdown gets Okay-ed that didn't seem okay... #BBCNFL #SuperBowl #Touchdown #NewEnglandPatriots
This play is huge. Defense has to do something here we can’t keep playing catch up. We need something big here. #SuperBowl  #SuperBowlLII #Patriots #GoPats  #PatriotsNation #PatsNation #NFL #GoPats  #NotDone
This has been fab. Most yards in #SuperBowl history already in the 3rd 1/4. Well worth that 50mins kip so I can fully appreciate it without the usual battle against sleep.
Best commercial EVER!!!!!! ❤️ it!!! #Jeep #jeepwrangler #O|||||||O  #JurassicPark #JurassicWorld #FallenKingdom #SBLII #SuperBowl

So the only teams able to beat the mighty @AtlantaFalcons in the Playoffs the past two seasons have been the Super Bowl Champions.... #JustSaying
Defense not been good enough in the front 7 all year, espcially after loosing Hightower. And it’s cost us tonight. Secondary was bad too apart from Gilmore. #Patriots #PatsNation #PatriotsNation #SuperBowl #SuperBowlLII #GoPats
@TamaraLChambers Im Irish &amp; American football just isn’t a big deal over here but for some reason on super bowl Sunday suddenly everyone loves American football. They don’t understand what is happening or who the teams are but they are big fans... for one day.

Super Bowl winners declaring themselves ‘World Champions’ is the original #FakeNews 🙄 #SuperBowl #SuperBowlLII
Looool. Anyone else see @KevinHart4real getting denied access to the presentation stage at the @SuperBowl 😂😂 #superbowl #KevinHart #denied https://t.co/NEb2Y7ILyw
Although I wore an Eagles jersey for the game. The Pats got very unlucky in the end there’s. Congrats Eagles on your first Super Bowl https://t.co/QY3B3NYcmn
Partidazo de los @Eagles!! Que grande es este deporte!! Lo peor de que acabe la Súper Bowl es que acaba también la temporada de NFL... tenemos por delante 7 largos meses sin football...
Very entertaining superbowl! #SuperBowl
What a way to cap a huge Philadelphia-themed fortnight. Eagles Super Bowl champs. Being in town for all the pre Bowl buzz. Seeing a show at the ECW Arena. I fucking love Philly. #FlyEaglesFly
Okay so can the Packers win the superbowl next year? Yeah? Thanks
staying up this late for Superbowl without booking Monday off was DUMB
I like watching the Superbowl, until they do the post game interviews and I realise they’re like, really REALLY american.
The big question though: Who starts for the @Eagles next season, @NFoles_9 or @cj_wentz ? #NFL #SuperBowl #Eagles
The beginning and the end of Malcolm Butler's Patriots career in a 4 year Super Bowl odessey that saw him make the game winning pick in the first.. and stand on the sideline in defeat #sblii
@PJDOT1 Best Superbowl I've ever seen and it was all out attack from the off. I had 41-50 points and it was basically laughed at with that score
Seriously the very best Super Bowl I’ve ever watched. #GoEagles 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Yes yes yes @ethancookie4 @Eagles #SuperBowl #champions #SuperBowlLII we bloody did it #FlyEaglesFly
Congrats my fellow Nigerian 🇳🇬brother @JayTrain . We(🇳🇬)are everywhere 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾.....Jay Òmó Ajayi ti ilu èkiti kètê #BlackExcellence #SuperBowl #Eagles #SuperBowl2018 https://t.co/KQxqrWPtIx
Philadelphia lawyers are absolutely gutted😒#SuperBowlnaESPN #SuperBowl52
BBC’s Super Bowl coverage was actually...good.
#SuperBowl was so worth staying up for 😴😮
Gutted that the Patriots lost but what a game that was. Credit to the Philadelphia Eagles. #SuperBowl
Cracking Super Bowl! Nothing beats a beaten Brady! #SBLll
May have lost the Super Bowl, but still so grateful to be able to enjoy it like I do because of this bean!
Thanks for introducing me to your sport and your team! Despite me planning plays for the Pats, it didn’t work out. I’ll make sure I plan the plays for our lives better! https://t.co/lqIr4P6SrZ
Called it. A whole three weeks in advance... #SuperBowl #ShouldHavePutMoneyOnIt https://t.co/Z2b3Qa7Goz
Seeing a lot of folks saying this is the best Super Bowl of all-time. Disagree. Steelers-Cards still the best I have ever seen.
What a game!! Congrats to the Philadelphia Eagles, deserved the win. 👏👏 #SuperBowl #FlyEaglesFly
@ericdier fly eagles fly !!!!!!!greatest Super Bowl ever !!
That Super Bowl was nuts. Could literally have gone the other way until the absolute final split second. Not quite a Brady classic, but close.
Fabulous SuperBowl, what a game! Well done to the @Eagles #SuperBowlSunday #SuperBowlLll
Best go and get some sleep. After all, it’s only a few months until the NBA Finals. #SuperBowl https://t.co/I28Rza3BQx

@DanMcShanemaate @DanMcShanemaate @Eagles superbowl champions 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
INSANE SUPER BOWL! Can't believe Eagles won but am so happy! Congratulations for their first ever Super Bowl🎉 #nfl #SuperBowlLll
Staying up through to the end got me..........
#SuperBowl https://t.co/0N9i9ff2Rd
Why does every football player than God? Pretty sure he didn’t help you with that touchdown #Superbowl
Awww foles kid 😄 #SuperBowl #flyeaglesfly
This ruined the #SuperBowl https://t.co/TQzKbzEYue
@ButterMyButts @Kingm11_ Going to be only superbowl champs without a stadium the next season
The fact that the CEO is the first to hoist the trophy and the coach thanks Jesus for the win tells you an awful lot about America tbh. #Superbowl
Nick Foles superbowl champion and MVP, fucking hell fire who would of thought #SuperBowl52
Love the NFL, love the #SuperBowl but absolutely can’t stand the claims of being “world champions” #wrong
So I just accidentally ended up watching the last 2 hours or so (second half) of the #Superbowl and now I'm going to be tired tomorrow... I don't even like sport...
I mean, fair play and all to @Eagles, but "World Champions"? Come on guys... #SuperBowl #Eagles https://t.co/ADudEuZ4WF
One thing that needs explaining to the Americans is that you can’t be “world champions” when you’re the only country competing!! #SuperBowl
Big @17AdamRooney at the #SuperBowl #eagles https://t.co/NyZwXS1mqm
Well played Philly, best Super Bowl ever? Had everything! Really pleased for former Dolphin @JayTrain superb effort
“We’re World Champions” - you are the only ones who play this sport 🙊#SuperBowl
@MiamiDolphins  turn next year ??😏🏈 #SuperBowl #GoFins
PERSONALY I LIKE PHILIDELPHIA ON TOAST,NOT IN A SUPER BOWL. 🤣
Quite enjoyed the Super Bowl tbh

Would recommend to a friend
@RonnieSloan_ I can’t lie to you Ronnie it’s rough, just remember they still have 3 to go to catch me and 4 to go to catch you, it’s just 1 super bowl
On a side note, how do they believe they are World Champions? You're the only country that plays 'American Football' professionally.

America is not the world.

#Superbowl #SBLII
What a great Super Bowl! 🏈Congrats to the Eagles 🦅.
haha the presenter does not want to let go of that mic. #epicfail #superbowl
Still makes me laugh how winning the super bowl makes you world champions when it’s only played in America😂🙈
Nick Foles MVP Super Bowl LII #myvote #FlyEagelsFly #SuperBowlLll #BirdGang #bbcnfl https://t.co/Vyll2BjDzu
In "soccer" you never see the owner going up and lifting the Premier League trophy.
Sport is everything but in America more than anywhere, money talks.
#superbowl
Oh the #Eagles are soaring high tonight.

#underdogs to #topdogs flying proud

#NFL #SuperBowl
It's 03:30am but I refuse to sleep until I see Tom Brady cry. #SuperBowl
Now for my annual complaint about how stupid the Lombardi presentation is. Giving it to the owner, mid interview. Needs to be done FA Cup style #SuperBowl
So John Terry has just turned up in Minnesota in a full Eagles kit!! 🦅 #Minnesota #PhiladelphiaEagles #SuperBowl #SuperBowlLII #fullkitwanker #NFL
@NiKKi_E13 Gracious in defeat, credit to you. The Patriots can be proud of themselves for being part of a sensational #SuperBowl final.
I love NFL so much but they're still not 'world champions' #SuperBowl
WHAT A GAME! Philadelphia Eagles deserve to win this incredible epic! Worth staying up till 03:30am to watch, an incredible Superbowl! #SuperBowl2018 #SuperBowlLll #bbcsuperbowl
My only experience of Philadelphia is with @RealCrazyBill but that was a fun visit... It's the closest tie I have to that city #SuperBowl
Just had a celebratory fart. Warm as fuck. #SuperBowl #Eagles
Best Super Bowl ive ever watched #SuperBowl #JayTrain with the British Flag.
What a game, what a night. Another successful @ukpackers Superbowl party #SuperBowl #SBLII https://t.co/K7hOWNBeGl
Eagles have been the best all round team all year and have shown it on the biggest stage. Thats 2/2 incredible #SuperBowl games ive seen. Vikings better be playing in it next year! The new season starts now. Mental! #SuperBowlLll #SBLll #EaglesPatriots #skol https://t.co/8ymd25T6yb
I consumed too many wings during the Super Bowl and now I have the worst chicken fatigue ever
Best #Superbowl since  1984 👏  I grudgingly admit that Brady is no doubt greatest qb but he could learn from Foles to be a better man - bad form leaving field in a huff #bbcnfl #NFLUK #SuperBowlLII #badloser
Welp, sucks to see the Pats lose, but today I got to see a man who just moved from Philadelphia witness his first Super Bowl win ever, in a foreign city with no friends but us. That alone makes it worth it 😇
Nick Foles has now got a Super Bowl MVP trophy
A game with a perfect passer rating where he threw for seven TDs
And a season where he led the league in passer rating... wild. #SBLII https://t.co/idyXsH4410
@AmyDouglasSings Its ok to hate the Patriots too hehe. #superbowl #SuperBowlLII
Redskins hands on the Super Bowl. Just as it should be. #HTTR #DarrellGreen
Another entertaining #superbowl @Giants season next season
Was that Kevin Hart trying to get on the podium?! #SuperBowl
What a game! Well done Eagles! #SuperBowl (Nick Foles traded to Patriots as starting QB for next season - I called it)
Wow... that was breathtaking! A fantastic #SuperBowl played out by 2 excellent teams. Congratulations to @Eagles... and a fitting time to win as we announced our partnership with our good friends @eagle_labs last week #Maker #Hack #Eagles https://t.co/hMTTObe9hL
Only #America could turn #SuperBowl Political 'Cause #TomBrady is a @realDonaldTrump supporter 😂
#Scotland done political hatred and sectarianism in sport first lads . #StepYoGameUp 😂 x
@sparkie316 Same here mate, but I’ve been up watching the Super Bowl and it’s not insomnia this time for me. I know how it feels though 😕

Only 200 days until college football starts. #SuperBowl
@ClassicoDeCosta I think we all love a bit of American footy my sweet but it gets little tv coverage. So when the Super Bowl is shown we all get excited.
Easily a classic super bowl right there
Eeeeeeeagles! #superbowl

YES! Eagles 💜So deserved. Fuck the patriots #SuperBowl
Plays Always Sunny theme tune.. #SuperBowl
@marcusjh17 When Wentz got injured I believe my quote was “Its a shame that, Nick Foles isn’t gonna take them to the Super Bowl and win it” 😂
Nick Foles daughter stole the night for me. Daddy running his arse off, she is more interested in her toy ^_^ #SuperBowl
Well done @eagles it was an amazing superbowl so tense! All out! #nomercy If going to lose to… https://t.co/JPZ50gRPOI
@Gazjor1 Happy times. I went see the #Eagles in the year that they won the Super Bowl.
Best #SuperBowl I’ve watched
Ngl I don’t know much about the NFL but that super bowl was awesome!
I’m pretty sure Relegation battles in the championship get more coverage than the #SuperBowl 😂
All time great superbowl that. Immense composure from the Eagles throughout. Fully deserved.
Two years in a row I’ve won money of the Super Bowl , wish it was every week 💷🏈
WOW WOW WOW #SuperBowl... What a game! Congratulations to the @Eagles... #NickFolesThatCatch
No one understands how happy I am that the patriots lost the super bowl 😭😭😭
Super Bowl was fucking lit
Not sure I’ve got the emotional capacity left to watch Nick. Bloody. Foles making a speech as MVP. #SuperBowl
Disappointing #SuperBowl
Ridiculous Super Bowl
We might have lost, but it was an incredible game. Wow! Kudos @Eagles. What a win! #SuperBowl
Not my team but really happy for the Eagles, stood tall to the usual Brady 4th quarter pressure saw it out... #gridiron #nfl #champions 🏈💪🏾#superbowl
Everything ya got, everything ya got...well played @Eagles @NFoles_9 #SBLII #SuperBowl
Only a #SuperBowl can make 60 seconds seem like an hour. Thank you for the show!  Now the 1 year wait begins for #SuperBowlLIII 😬
Best super bowl game I’ve watched! Congratulations @Eagles!! https://t.co/J9CKAwKi2D
I've predicted the correct result for 5/6 #SuperBowl s

What a game! Delighted for the #Eagles Great attacking mindset, totally worth staying up for. #SuperBowl
Simply incredible #SuperBowl - got to be up there with the best ever. Play calling by the @Eagles was brave. They well and truly seized the moment to deliver once in a lifetime result @SkySportsNFL
LEGIT FEEL LIKE IM ON THE EAGLES AND I TOO WON A SUPER BOWL #flyeaglesfly
When you wake up early to go Prague and your dad is still up watching the #SuperBowl 😄

Nick Foles. SuperBowl winner. 😎🦅🦅🦅
On a Super Bowl high but about to enter the abyss of the off-season
So so so upset over that loss. It was such an intense and nerve wracking game, and now crushed that we didn’t get the Super Bowl. Have to come back again next year #NotDone

Fair play to the eagles,they've been excellent all year but boy that sucks #SuperBowl
I’d Love to be in Philly Tonight and the rest of the week. #FlyEaglesFly #Superbowl CHAMPIONS
What a game! Most excited sporting event I’ve watched in a long time! Congrats Eagles 🦅 #SuperBowl
Too many big plays, 3rd down completions, and lack of pass rush pressure. Offense couldn’t overcome that in the end. #SuperBowl  #SuperBowlLII #Patriots #GoPats  #PatriotsNation #PatsNation #NFL #GoPats
@SuperBowl #SuperBowl Surely #TomBrady this is his last Superbowl. Bow out to a loss for the Greatest? Wait n see #SuperBowl52 🏈 @Patriots @Eagles

What a game! Shame Brady couldn’t work his magic in the end but congrats to the Eagles. Must say how good the #BBCNFL coverage has been, informative and entertaining. Nice to have another British born Super Bowl champion in @JayTrain too!
Literally have no horse in the race when it came to the #SuperBowl but I wanted #Eagles to win just to see Tom Brady lose. Just don't like the look of him. Seems like a prick.
That Foles TD was a thing of beauty. Good job Eagles! #Eagles #superbowl
That was a much better Super Bowl than last year! #DillyDilly
What a game! 🏈 well done #eagles #SuperBowl
When you placed a bet on the eagles to win the Super Bowl months ago #winnings #alwaysnew #foles
Even watching the Super Bowl in its entirety couldn’t defeat my jet lag. #SuperBowl

No ha podido ser, aún así un auténtico partidazo, puro espectaculo. Gracias papá por enseñarme este deporte antes incluso de tener uso de conciencia, una pena no poderlo haber visto contigo como todos los años 😔 #SuperBowl
The most important thing about the Superbowl finishing... BASEBALL IS BACK SOON!!! @RaysBaseball
Patriots got cheated big time, if not 1, 2 touchdowns shouldn't of stood in the eagles favour  #SuperBowl
You can absolutely bank on whoever I bet on to win the Super Bowl will lose
Nick Foles For MVP #superbowl
What a Super Bowl! Well worth the three hours sleep I’ll get 🦅🙄😂. #FlyEagelsFly

- The Philadelphia Eagles won the Super Bowl

So extremely happy that @Eagles won Superbowl LII! https://t.co/PLm58wZ5jI

That Super Bowl was perhaps the best I've ever seen. Some very good defence mixed in with some outstanding offence followed up by even better coaching. This is gonna be one I watch over and over

When you wake up to the #Eagles winning the #SuperBowl yesssss #NFL #uknfl #Americanfootball
Waking up to fully formed Superbowl memes and having absolutely no idea... https://t.co/uYpfyUUQTg
Eagles winning the #SuperBowl was nothing but deserved. Been the best team all season, roll on next season
Woken up to lots of Super Bowl trending topics and that one Jack Pearson trend 😭😭. Gotta watch it tonight after work. Must.avoid.spoilers #thisisus
@BBCBreakfast 
Why are you 'bigging-up' SuperBowl? 
A very small minority sport in UK. 
Anything to do with commercial interests? Or is it because NFL is anti-American and anti-Trump
Congratulations #PhiladelphiaEagles #nfl #SuperBowl

I love Superbowl Sunday and it has nothing to do with the game of hand egg that is being played.

All of the movie trailers!!!
Waking up to friends’ snapchats in Philly post #SuperBowl win.... 😂🏈💥
Here we go eagles here we go 🏆🏈 another cracking Super Bowl #FlyEagleFly #SuperBowlLII #EaglesvsPatriots

So the Eagles won #SuperBowl 🏈.  I'm pleased; I like underdogs winning
Superbowl is a pile of horse shit.    The yanks go daft for it,  imagine they had seen the Tennents sixes .  Be mayhem.
What day does super bowl finish? Am I right in thinking it's 30 minutes in-game play over a fortnight with 9 concerts thrown in for good measure. Oh and nachos..lots of.nachos https://t.co/Th7XgpOWil
Had 🍹 and lots of 🍿🍿🍿last night 🌃 Great game Super Bowl🎳 😁😁😁 it was great viewing 👏👏 Good morning🌄 have a great day 👍
@SamiHaycox We have a Super Bowl party every year at our house! 🏉🇺🇸
That’s the first #SuperBowl I’ve not watched since 2004. It was a great run but, frankly, I was tuckered out.

Rob McElhenney deserves credit for increasing the Eagles’ fanbase worldwide via the power of a very good long running show.

@GMB ever heard of #SpoilerAlert I am livid, I recorded the Super Bowl to watch this morning..... 🤬🤬😡😡🤯
A lot of people who were outraged by the treatment of Colin Kaepernick and boycotted the NFL seemed to be all up in the Superbowl last night 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

Superbowl every month? Enlighten me?

Everyone I know banging on about Super Bowl last night. I couldn’t sleep so turned it on. Didn’t have a scooby what was going on asides every time someone breathed they paused the game. Turned it off within minutes.
It's great to be waking up this morning knowing the patriots are not the Superbowl champs..#FlyEagleFly
@NFLUK @SuperBowl @JayTrain A better result for @JayTrain than he git when he came to #Wembley last October against dem @Saints 😉

WELL DONE!
Great flying @Eagles, great flying high! Congratulations to the whole @Eagles outfit, #SBLII  #SUPERBOWLCHAMPS 🦅 Great win for the institution and for the people of Philly. What a @SuperBowl! Eat tail feathers Tommy-boy! #FlyEaglesFly

Is anyone really bothered about the Super Bowl #notforme
When someone mentions to me today the Eagles won the Superbowl https://t.co/ONtBp8ZY3D
@Davebolts @JamesAFC16 He wont take the piss. He knows what it feels like. Losing a superbowl is like arsenal not finishing 4th.
I value my sleep more than fake rugby. #SuperBowl
The outcome of this #SuperBowl really has me conflicted as a @giants fan.
Love how Americans class the super bowl winners as ‘World Champions’ like any other country plays ‘American football’ #SuperBowlSunday
Missed the Super Bowl for the first time in 6 years. However did win some money on the Eagles win. Got their revenge on the Pats
🦅 Good lads 🦅🏈🏈🏈🏈@SuperBowl
Aaaa czyli Super Bowl to taki dodatek do trailerow tak?
I feel a tactical nap is going to be needed to get through today, but totally worth it for a great superbowl last night

Well done @Eagles. Although @clo13 &amp; I spent a year in Boston we also spent great times on the shore near Philly. Best Superbowl in years. As to quarterbacks changing over today-The King is dead, long live the King @NFoles_9. 😉 https://t.co/8frpkmA9s0

For a team to even make the #SuperBowl after losing there Quarterback is unbelievable. To then go on and win it, fair play @Eagles fully deserved. Would they have won it with Wentz..🤔 We’ll be back next year @Patriots 🏆

@BBCBreaking The coverage and punditry you guys gave was very good. But alas, not even that, the exciting game, or Justin Timberlake could keep me awake right to the end. I was knackered after my own personal super bowl, a 15-mile run! #PhiladelphiaEagles #sotired #SuperBowlLII
Good to see The Eagles beat The Patriots in the Super Bowl Having a different winner makes it less stale so I’m all for it
Didn't wake up to the #SuperBowl result I was hoping for, but the parts I saw were certainly entertaining 🏈
Who from the UK actually enjoys the Superbowl and isn't just pretending to try and look cool?
I’m assuming all the patriots fans, are creating PowerPoint presentations as to how they were robbed? #SuperBowl
Didn't see #SBLII but apparently if you search “Justin Timberlake", this is the first thing that comes up.

Guessing the half-time show went well then. 😂

Only watch athletics when it's at the Olympics: sound.

Only watch American football at the superbowl: you can't do that ya maniac, why don't you watch it all year?!
@markchapman has reawakened my interest in American Football this year. Good weekly coverage @BBCSport too. @SuperBowl was amazing last night. I didn’t stay the course so left it recording to watch today.
@lowey133 @NFLUK @Eagles @SuperBowl Redskins fan myself I'd much rather them than the Pats. Now if it was the Cowboys than its a different story...

@JackHumphrey87 By my reckoning it’s Eagles 4, Giants 8. Something I’ve been working on recently made me realise the most common NFL Championship game match up (inc Super Bowl) ever is Bears v Giants. Think 8 meetings in total off the top of my head
Still can’t get over how good the super bowl was last night 🏈🏈🇺🇸🇺🇸

Amazing result for #FlyEaglesFly at the #SuperBowl but cant@help thinking the ‘celebrations’ have gone a bit too far?
I'm glad the Eagles won cos all the entire Superbowl footage was about how much the media want to inhale Brady's dick over and over again.

Not knocking Brady cos that's a hell of a career but there wasn't just one player on that field.
@DGDGS_ I haven’t seen it yet, only the final score but let’s just say the patriots have had their “fair share” of decisions going their way both on the way to this superbowl and for many other seasons
Congratulations to the team that won the handegg in between all the commercials #SuperBowl
Superbowl trapped me and played a teaser trailer for the Han Solo film where I couldn't escape the fact it was on. There goes my "no spoilers" and avoiding things before watching it at all costs.

Congratulations #PhiladelphiaEagles on winning the Super Bowl!
#Brady walking off without acknowledging handshake offer from Foles, #Gronkowski talking about retirement. Classless, arrogant, cry babies. #SuperBowl https://t.co/MpE2656RLT
And on the unlikeliest of Super Bowl MVPs, the Hollywood ending for a player who almost quit the game 

https://t.co/qVkHtETeAL
I’ve never seen my feed so full of one person... anyone comment on JT at the Super Bowl? Nah didn’t think so...back to Kylie then...
We watched the final amazing play in the France vs Ireland European football match in a London Pub and then got home in time to watch the last quarter of the Super Bowl at home on Iowa. #GoodTimes https://t.co/Jhm54syYW2
I’m extremely offended that JT wore camouflage bottoms for his SuperBowl performance

@wesmanchild must be a mess right now. Congrats on the #SuperBowl win man. At least one of your teams is getting it done
@ladybdashwood And yet you offered no resistance! #NFL Super Bowl makes late night snacking kings of us all
@jtimberlake Super Bowl performance, just wow 👏👏👏

Super Bowl.. Phfft!..
#JustinTimberlake was better than I thought he'd be but still... meh. #SuperBowl
Man, I can't wait for @alwayssunny 's super bowl episode next year
Liverpool v Spurs and all the trailers is all the Super Bowl I need 👍🏻
Best part of the Super Bowl is that the winners are the ‘world champions’ for a sport that’s only played in America
Today is national pull a sickie day. I stayed up until 3am for the Super Bowl, still in. 5....yes 5 of my team have called me sick this AM. #NationalSickieDay #SuperBowlLll #beamanagertheysaid #itwillbefuntheysaid
@paddypower They are always suspiciously fresh these overnight experts who apparently watched the superbowl and got 2 hours sleep
I've been seeing a lot of tweets about a #SuperbOwl lately. Here's a throwback to my teenage work experience with the @BarnOwlTrust. Both juveniles have since become significantly less fluffy... https://t.co/GJdUIy6Eki
Another #SuperBowl Ive watched and what a truly phenomenal game between both sides,congrats @Eagles #FlyEaglesFly
@EaglesMCR That’s a title I don’t like. Super Bowl champions yes but you can’t be world champions unless you open it up to other countries. If my team wine the FA Cup or the Premier League they are not world champs 🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅
Jim White has obviously never had the chance to go to the Super Bowl! Good job it didn’t clash with a group game otherwise he’d needed to take a sickie😉#gravytrain https://t.co/HEp1nKt4EQ
As a tribute to Philadelphia winning the Super Bowl it’s infernally fucking cold out there

Havent seen the #SuperBowl halftime show with JT. How was it? I’m hearing some mixed reactions. And yeah Congrats Philadelphia Eagles! #FlyEaglesFly
@Tw0fl0wer @audubonsociety I think I might agree with you there! #SuperbOwl
Can't help but think of how overjoyed Dennis, Mac, Charlie, Sweet Dee and Frank would be about the #Eagles being  Super Bowl champions. Turns out that yes in 2018 #ItsAlwaysSunnyInPhiladelphia 🤙🏼

Everyone's been talking about the Super Bowl, but I'm just sat here like "How much longer now till the Oscars?" https://t.co/616aAthEFU
@elliottnash96 Haha I just love an underdog so I was rooting for the eagles last night, my pal is a patriot as well so I just wanted to spite them
I only ever watch the Superbowl tbh, night start watching the full league
Superbowl haltime performance is always so cringey how they have all them people around the stage obviously being told to be super enthusiastic
What a weekend! What a Superbowl! #SuperBowl 🏈
As for the other Superbowl spots...they're 30 seconds long. That's not long enough to form an opinion.
The culture really won the Superbowl. 😭❤ #SBLII
I feeeeeeeel... That Justin could have worn a snazzier outfit for the Super Bowl...

Stayed up late to watch the Eagles fly to their first Super Bowl win and now need a little extra… https://t.co/PsEI2aOtny
@urban356rs Yep. Ah, of course a bit of a trade off for the Super bowl I suppose. :/ Sending you strength for the icky stuff, A. You can do it.🤗
Fully regretting staying up for the super bowl last night right now 🙃
so happy for @Eagles winning the super bowl wish i was still over there now celebrating with them #flyhighasaeagle

Don’t understand all this Super Bowl news this morning, I’ve had a super bowl for years, you can put it in a microwave &amp; it doesn’t melt!
Can everyone give over about Super Bowl 😩
Congratulations @Eagles! #Superbowl
A good thing we get out of the Super Bowl is all the new trailers and announcements that the commercials give us. #SoloAStarWarsStory
I genuinely just looked down to check I had a matching pair of shoes on.... #Superbowl #tired
Not booking the day off was a very bad decision 😴😴 #FlyEaglesFly #SuperBowl
Woke up early to see all the Super Bowl trailers! Its way too overwhelming! So excited for movies this year #solotrailer #missionimpossible #InfinityWarTrailer
Ian Jay Ajayi the first British player to win the Superbowl?? #allaboardthejaytrain
*checks superbowl results* ffs why do I never put money on these things?
The winners of the Super Bowl could at least beat the best team in Canada before claiming to be ‘World Champions’.... #eagles #nfl

The office is spooky. Post Super Bowl &amp; no AC hum.
I only got to half time last night.🤧 So I just CAUGHT UP ON  @jtimberlake #SuperBowl half-time show. Brilliant! https://t.co/jPLbjBDfis
Didn’t enjoy waking up this morning and seeing all the SuperBowl tweets after I had watched the previous 3, but work gonna work

Staying up to watch most of the Super Bowl last night is starting to catch up with me 😴
Now that @jtimberlake has performed at the #SuperBowl , Does this mean he will be announcing a #WorldTour soon. #ihopeso
How does winning the #SuperBowl make you World champions? Only played in One country 🤔
Just caught up with last 10 mins of Super Bowl. Wow! What a game, had everything. Delighted for the Eagles 👏🏻👏🏻

Say it every year but the Superbowl is terrible, American football is terrible.
Tried watching the super bowl this morn, after 5 mins of just talking shite I’ve decided to watch an episode of take the high road instead....America’s game would bore the bag of ye!!!!
@JimWhite @talkSPORT Gareth could just watch the game back later on the super bowl is an amazing spectacle and in person one of the most memorable sporting events possible
@rose_hamilton94 soooo far did you get Into the Superbowl? I'm guessing like half an hour?
Just waking up after the longest day yesterday. Church, Young Adults Ministry, engagement party and then the Superbowl party. Buzzing for the #Eagles winning their first #SBLII
@bobmillstt Why not go to the Super Bowl? Southgate would have learnt nothing new at Anfield yesterday. If players need a break from too much football, maybe managers do too.
Post Super Bowl party clean up is done, laundry is in process and I have party food to eat for lunch, happy daysssss. 
Gonna have to double up on my #jp #berries though!
@JimWhite Southgate was obviously at the Super Bowl to find a player who is capable of catching a ball, otherwise he will be between the sticks himself in Russia!

Took advantage of being off work today and stayed up to watch the super bowl last night. Never watched NFL in my life, but was actually quite good. Although it was on for fucking ages. Think I'll be an Eagles fan! 🦅🏈🏆
That monkey had predicted the last 7 winners of the superbowl and got all 7 right, trusted it to make me some money ladt night and it got it wrong the fucking prick
What a great showing last night at the Super Bowl!!! Few nervous kicks at the start, but the Eagles deserved it. Just glade those misses didn’t cost either team a ring #NFL #SuperBowlSunday

@AfcFreddie Been watching super bowl for years. I remember in 1994 when the Miami dolphins had their mascot 'snowflake' stolen and they had to get in this detective who specialised in pets. Turned out former player Ray Finkle had a sex change and stole it. What a year
Fell asleep with 5 minutes left of the Super Bowl and missed everything gg
In bed at 4:00. Up at 6 with Matilda. Worth it. Great #Superbowl and not just because the Patriots lost. Exciting and record-breaking from start to finish.
Well after the SuperBowl last night today is pretty much a write off! I’ll check back in tomorrow. Cheers.
The people of #Philadelphia are practically morons. Win the #Superbowl so destroy your home? Lacking a lot of mental capabilities if you ask me.
Congrats to Eagles winning the SuperBowl! #SuperBowl #FlyEagelsFly

@JamieFenderbaum Well everyone has to watch Superbowl in the US. You go to prison if you don't. So they chuck in a bit of singing for the kids... Well something like that. 😂
Spent like 30 mins watching the Super Bowl commercials and trailers this morning. The only time of the year I ever want to watch ads #TideWasTheBest
Just caught up with #Superbowl highlights. That touchdown by Foles though! 👌🏈

An annoying thing about last night... after the hall Mary, they kept showing the replay and talking about how close Gronk was rather than talking about eagles just winning their first super bowl  &amp; showing players emotions.
The stats confirm that last nights Super Bowl #SBLII was not only the best Super Bowl in history but also offensively the best and most entertaining game in NFL history. What a brilliant night! Well done @Eagles Well deserved! 🦅🏈🔥🍺🌭🇺🇸 #SuperBowl2018 #BBCNFL https://t.co/xhCRRcfE1c

A weekend full of football, Six Nations Rugby, Davis Cup &amp; much more. So why does the BBC sport website headline say "Records tumble as Eagles stun Patriots in Super Bowl" ...Who gives a monkey's chuff about this "sport"?
@PlanetRockRadio Wyatt, as I stayed up until 4:30am celebrating Philadelphia winning the Super Bowl last night. Any chance of playing some Eagles, Life In The Fast Lane? Cheers!
@cyclopsing I use @Wix  myself even before @rhettandlink joined the promo team &amp; I never in the slightest felt put out because 2 guys had the superbowl commercial. Why does everything have to be sexest or political? I'm just happy they went with 2 amazing comedians x
@ZERTZ_86 @Eagles @NFL @SNFonNBC @SuperBowl You were awesome 😎👏🏻
So glad I booked a day off work today, Super Bowl has me written off 😴

My Super Bowl verdict - so glad @Eagles won it, amazing game and fun to watch. @jtimberlake nailed it. (And I kind of fell asleep at the beginning of the third quarter but life circumstances have changed.)
Lol 😂 at all those instagram ‘models’ posing with a football 🏈 in their undies like ‘oh hey it’s the SuperBowl, I just love me some strategically placed balls!! ‘ 👀
10 tins of dark fruits and a good few gins watching the Superbowl last night and not even a hint of a hangover. I'm scared
Kelly Ranting after the Super Bowl was quite Funny. Have to say did quite enjoy the Super Bowl last night and if that Eagles QB was a back up at the start of the season he certainly isn’t going to be one anymore. Fair play good underdog story. Well done Philadelphia
Never understood why people get so excited over fake rugby.

Aw, fuck, I suppose I'm going to have to. Congratulations @Homer_the_black and your Eagles on finally winning a Superbowl.

@RokiahKhan Hmm not sure. Both the 89' and 90' Superbowl against the Bengals and Broncos are right up there for me.
Almost forgot my annual #SuperbOwl tweet https://t.co/ZdkPCucV2x
Congratulations to Philadelphia Eagles winning Superbowl 52 absolute brilliant game from start to finish don't think I've ever shouted that much at the TV wanting the Eagles to win
The more I read about the #SuperBowl the better it gets. Essentially turned into a gun fight with Tom Brady, and Nick Bloody Foles won it.
can u imagine if the redskins won the super bowl with Colt McCoy
@screencrushnews This IS the one from the SuperBowl. At least it's the one I saw earlier on calling it the teaser trailer.
&gt; wins Super Bowl

&gt; destroys their own city

#Philadelphia
@DrMark37 Super Bowl? Was too poorly to stay up to watch it, recorded it so will watch it tonight, haven’t seen any result yet!
Super Bowl 2018! Not an American football fan at all but what a night!!! #SuperBowl @ Le Bateau… https://t.co/5UPfrDvnRF
Massive credit to Foles! Back up all season, steps up when it mattered! SuperBowl MVP! 👏👏 #SuperBowlLII #FlyEaglesFly

@NeilWainwright7 People on my TL who never post about it..... have started and it’s because “you have to it’s the Super Bowl” yeah no I’m good ta lol
Won more on the superbowl last night than I have on footie bets so far this year 🤷🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️.  Embarrassing.
Great Super Bowl! Also fuck the Patriots
@StevenMcinerney Shameful the way sky push the Super Bowl. Just so they can put it all on pay per view when they have made it more popular. Call me cynical.
Now Philly, this is what you should be aiming for when it comes to celebrating last nights victory - not riots and looting.  You won a super bowl, not a free tele from the shop window! 😒#PhillyRiots https://t.co/4yEzwvmiGd
Absolute touch of class from @jtimberlake to dedicate a song to @LFC last night! Cry me a river was just perfect after the day they had #Class #JustinTimberlake #SuperBowl #COYS #THFC #CryMeARiver

Based on what I've seen of Justin Timberlake's Superbowl half-time show, if you didn't know who he was, you'd assume he randomly won a competition to perform it.

Around 8pm last night. I wanted an early night so I started watching @AltCarb on @NetflixUK to help me catch some shut eye before the Super Bowl. 

I’m am now sitting in my car on my lunch break wondering if to save ep 10 till I get home

I missed the Super Bowl by the way
I'm not American and I don't get the #SuperBowl at all.

That being said, here's what I've got.

The story is #Philadelphia final beat the unbeatable #Patriots and won the big one. To celebrate, they destroy their own city? I'm confused...

Was an absolute pleasure watching that Super Bowl last night 🏈
@ChelseaAltLeft @CFCGARYG @BowdenCFC87 So if you win your group you basically go into the semis of the conference . 2 games from the Super Bowl ? Think I may try go over next han and see a play off game
He may be on the inside but meek mill really won superbowl
I don’t get it? Let’s celebrate winning the #SuperBowl by trashing our own city! Good job Eagles fans, good job. 🤔

That @jtimberlake halftime show was unreal! #superbowl #JustinTimberlake
The #Eagles victory last night means that the #NFCEast is the only division in the current #NFL structure to have all its teams win a SuperBowl
@HLTCO 90% of the tickets at a superbowl are corporate and a handful of real fans could afford the others - search the celebrations in Philly after the game and you'll get the proper fan reaction
I just watched JT’s halftime show at the Super Bowl. My god aren’t Americans over the top?!
love how everyone’s suddenly an expert on american football when the super bowl comes round every year
@mikewhitesport @ashlord23 Only 7 months to go until next season, will it be the season of the Pack (at last) or will Grop lead the 49’s to Super Bowl 53 ?

@SeanFitzpaddy It is the cup final. Essentially, the NFL is the Champions League if they got rid of all the domestic leagues. (2) group stages in the regular season, knockout post-season games leading to the Super Bowl.

I can’t believe Jennifer Lopez was relegated to the ‘pre-Superbowl’ show to make way for the absolute shit show that was Justin Timberlake to play halftime... should have been the other way round. Even Pink who sang the National Anthem would have been better. #SuperBowl
Justin Timberlake's half time show was simply awful. The worst I've seen by a long stretch. It's about time they got a proper performer booked for this. Bring back Bruce Springsteen! #Superbowl

Just watched the #superbowl. What a game but why do they keep saying world champs 😆
@Pink Amazing Superbowl performance but can you now please announce UK tour dates??
I had no interest in #SuperBowl but I'm really going to miss @paddypower Snapchat story 😓😓😓
@jtimberlake on HT Superbowl though! Whatever music he creates just has rhythm &amp; makes you wanna shake what your momma gave you 💃🏼💃🏼💃🏼🔥 

P.S plz come to Newcastle &amp; reunite with NSYNC for one night!
@Sareyware @jtimberlake Just watching super bowl now 👊🏻
@taylrn Remember what happened when Timberlake and Janet Jackson were on stage at Super Bowl together in 2004? https://t.co/JtoTXye98E
The day after the Super Bowl is always such a write-off.

You can not deny @jtimberlake’s talent. What a fucking performance!!! 👏🏻 #SuperBowl
OMG wow #SelfieKid monetised SO BLOODY FAST after fame from being accidentally the guy #JustinTimberlake chose from the #SuperBowl to take a selfie with. Good luck boy! Cheering on the braces and multi-platform hype! https://t.co/LQSOY9noux

Sheagirls fans rioting in their own city after they win the Superbowl. Fucking Clampetts!
@KatDealOfficial Thinking of starting a campaign. Kat Deal for the @nfl @SuperBowl Halftime Show.
So super bowl was amazing eh? Never seen such a close game! @ Brighton https://t.co/OApxpoeP2W
Am I sad for just watching and analysing the best Super Bowl ads? Probably...
When Carson Wentz went down, everyone instantly moved the Eagles from favourites right to the bottom of the bunch. They might win one playoff game. But they won't be able to compete with the best to even get to the Superbowl, let alone win it.
Watched the timberlake halftime show I slept thru last night , didn’t miss much , pretty average #SuperBowl #JustinTimberlake
I watched my first ever Superbowl in 2005 when Donovan McNabb went real close. I never thought the team that would go one better would have Foles at the helm. But he has been superb. Everyone wrote him off.
How is done. #SuperBowl https://t.co/CNh7jcFpRu
I'm still in disbelief at yesterday's game...
I have waited 13 years to even see the Eagles go back to the Superbowl, let alone win it. It's extremely surreal. I've never seen one of my teams win something. #FlyEaglesFly
Can’t drop the Super Bowl MVP now cheeky trade for Wentz 😂😂 #GiantsPride
@kfdailey @MikeTokes It's not about the game #SuperBowl 
THIS is #Rothschild and #Soros s paid BRAINLESS #slaves at work
And it’s EXACTLY the type of film that it’s SuperBowl stunt should be used for. I got back home today sat with my gf and watched something undemanding and inoffensive.
Well it’s been completely spoiled but time for the #SuperBowl all the same!
#SuperBowlLll #Superbowl #JustinTimberlake just watched his #Prince performance and tribute in his home town Minneapolis too. Brilliantly done !
There needs to be an equivalent of Super Bowl ads in the U.K.  Some of them are absolutely fantastic.
Watching the Super Bowl episode of This Is Us. Right before I check the smoke alarms are working....
Also great 30 second Super Bowl spots for Avengers: Infinity War &amp; A Quiet Place and a tremendous trailer for season 2 of Westworld. Bring on April for that one 😁
Justins #SuperBowl performance has shattered my teenage dreams. It’s like watching my Dad on karaoke or something &amp; it’s just PLAIN WRONG https://t.co/s8b8YecURG
Super Bowl Boxing Day in the Huxtable house chicken wings and all. I’d forgotten just how much I love Justin Timberlake - phenomenal performance JT!
Thoughts on Super Bowl spots/new trailers: Solo looks really great, was worried about this one but the first trailer has eased my mind. MI: Fallout, looks like another good MI film. Jurassic World 2, second trailer far better than the first. Skyscraper, yeah, I’ll see it!
@Eagles Congratulations on winning the #SuperBowl #FlyEaglesFly https://t.co/KwjaZfMCBT

Wow! What a game!! Right to the end. JT was amazing in the half time show. And Mayweather dresses up as Huggy Bear just topped it all off!
Unbelievable from @Eagles

I may not be American, but I’m happy that the Eagles won the Super Bowl #SuperBowl2018 #EaglesWin 🦅🏈
I was wondering how long it would take @BillSimmons to take a shot at  Matt Patricia in his post #SuperBowl podcast - 13 seconds. @ringer

Seeing a lot of people stating they are suffering #SuperBowl hangover today. I’m on nights again so it’s a blessing for me not to be tired at this time.
Just watched Justin’s super bowl...was nowhere near as bad as the reviews....
I can’t hear Timberlake #winning #ahwell #superbowl
Watching the Super Bowl. Hands down THE sexiest sporting event. I love it and watch it every year, but I couldn’t watch American Football every week. Can you imagine?! Once a year is enough

I've accepted the Patriots loss. Doesn't feel as bad as the Giants superbowl losses.
Fair play to the Eagles, arguably the best team this season right from day 1 👏

...but that Clement TD 100% gets overturned if not for the negative circus around Pats/James overturn in week 15
Watched my first #SuperBowl last night. What a game!!!!
@AussieF1Fanatic @jtimberlake But the Super Bowl show was fantastic! Focus on that, Nafe!
JT came to Chelmsford. He played in the park at V Festival, and he was fab!
@JordFxOfficial BBC coverage of the Super Bowl one of the commentators learnt what squeaky bum time meant lol
Watching the super bowl awesome game well done the eagles
they’ve just played Justin Timberlake’s Super Bowl medley in spoons and I’m living a bit x
Well that was a brilliant Super Bowl glad I managed to avoid the score all day to watch it with the laaaads 😂 https://t.co/o3DDZF0dzJ
Hate to think what they would have done had they lost https://t.co/zhYPqCSlHe #Eagles #WhatTheHell
But what is a ‘super bowl’?
Stayed off social media all to watch @Patriots in the Super Bowl against @Eagles, well worth the wait but not the result I wanted 😡 well played eagles, there’s always next year #gopatriots
@KevAnthony2 @SuperBowl @JTargentina Sorry, are you a fan of his? 😂
Would love to know what @TheRock text @KevinHart4real after he got denied access to celebrate on stage with the #Eagles at the #SuperBowl Haha . No way do i think he would let it slide without at least some comments ! haha #accessdenied

2 wrong TD decisions, defence didn’t play well enough. Tom was terrific. The missed trick play on 3rd down was gutting. Cooks being ruled out. No Butler?! HOWEVER great story for Foles and congrats Eagles on 1st Super Bowl win. Winning £100 kinda made up for it though #superbowl

Watching Super Bowl last night and realised that it was first time I’d ever done that! Then noticed that the 30 min half had taken 90mins and then Timberland appeared! Time was swiftly called on that craziness!
How many of you Chelsea players were up till 4am watching the Superbowl? Awful performance from a team that had no desire and passion to win that game tonight.
the third instalment of the cloverfield franchise announced during the superbowl and that it’ll be premiered on NETFLIX that night, woahhhh
@KevAnthony2 Watched @SuperBowl #sbLII last night and the half time entertainment was provided by @JTargentina , Justin Timberlake. #Notmycupoftea !😂
Finally allowing myself back on social media after successfully avoiding the Superbowl result all day! WHAT A GAME! #SuperBowlLll
Congratulations to the Philly Eagles on an astonishing offensive display to take Superbowl 52.
@Pokemonh8r What's the superbowl? ... Kitchen talk?
Watching the super bowl highlights and seeing Tom Brady getting sacked and subsequently losing is just pure.
I could understand fans rioting because their team lost the Super Bowl, but these fans won 🤯🤷🏻‍♂️ https://t.co/9PZGhgx2sH

Fast forward to Superbowl 52 after four years of just checking scores, watching odd game, and SB. Magic.

Monday marked 13 years since the Patriots became the last team to win back to back Super Bowls 

In that time 15 different teams have contested the Super Bowl and there have been 10 different winners

The most competitive league in the world does not reside in England
American Sport still baffles me.

Watching #SuperBowl - 3 times I heard players and coaches at the end refer to themselves as world champions and having the best team in the world. No wonder they've put an idiot in charge.
This is better than a super bowl win!! https://t.co/vud9trYlbH
Rewatched the Super Bowl, some favourite moments for me that will probably be lost in the madness of the game we’re the routes run by Gronk for his first score and Hogan for his TD, and just how Blount ran in general. Completely outplayed Ajayi

No better way to celebrate your superbowl win than to destroy your own city !
Really dont see this big deal about @KevinHart4real being drunk during the super bowl and people going he made a dick of himself! Big Fucking wow! He is allowed to enjoy himself, especially after the result! Every sports fan has done it!! I have made a dick of myself a lot 😂😂
So now the Superbowl is all done I wonder if @nflnetwork would like some @TOwolfpack footage To Cover The Off season.

@Johnny_Logo Yeah was realised straight after the Super Bowl

So happy for 2️⃣ of my favourite Sports journalists : @ColleenWolfeNFL &amp; @_JohnGonz ; How they kept their professionalism throughout a historic week for their beloved 🦅🦅🦅 &amp; arguably most famous #SuperBowl of all time is mind boggling 😱👏🏾👏🏾 https://t.co/WvcnB8kckw

If the NFL have Doug Pederson or Nick Foles mid’d up in the #superbowl they need to hurry up and get that out there so I can hear the QBs reaction to the #phillysurprise bbeing called??
I love the internet.

Who Should Perform at the Super Bowl Halftime Show in 2019? My answer: Adam Lambert + Queen. What do you think? https://t.co/Hjf870idaV
Let me just say, JT’s definitely got his sexy back... Super Bowl performance. BOOMZ.
Lots of Americans cheering and music. I thought it was the super bowl half-time show for a minute. #falconheavy #spacex
My attention spans going crazy with #superbowl and #falconheavy #spacex at the same time. 
The pace of the world has already 10x and going to 1000x in the years to come. Hope to see a Super Bowl in Mars :)
@cherrrysirens @_dnbrns Nope, they haven’t released any info yet, now the SuperBowl is outta the way it’ll be soon I’d imagine, don’t worry tho al sort it out
To anyone wanting a paper celebrating to superbowl. They were available to order online....have a look you may still be in luck!!

This is so cool. Nick Foles talking Doug Pederson into one of the biggest plays in Super Bowl history - his 4th down touchdown catch at the end of the 1st half. The look between the two as Foles asks to call that play.....just brilliant stuff considering what was on the line. https://t.co/CqPYBffwt7

If he goes back should get Foles 😏
R/superbowl isn't about the super bowl
@maniacmiler @alxterrell @JayTrain Not until Sunday - the BBC coverage mentioned it quite a bit. 2nd Briitsh born Superbowl winner apparently
@NickOfJones @NFL @SuperBowl 49ers will go close. 14/1 to make it

Finally caught up on the #SuperBowl adverts... Loved the @tide and @amazon ones... well done, they are the winners of the ads in my book 🙌🏼
That’s not a trailer. This is a trailer... https://t.co/gk0DgiiAsI

@JLTFC 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽Ive been arguing this for weeks

even superbowl the other night- tech is not the saviour and in many ways has only served to open up a whole new can of worms cos now officials are under pressure to review

Only remedy now is to give each side 2 VAR referrals each.
Just read “pack mentality” is respect of Timberlake’s Super Bowl “show!” No it’s not at all, the show wasn’t very good and most people agree with that!

Justin Timberlake’s superbowl half time show got me in my feelings
@K1ngo @HannahDrake628 Why would anyone else be expected to, he was the one onstage with her. It’s only come back because he was invited back to the Super Bowl, highlighting the inequity of the whole thing once again. I’m not losing sleep over it but can still see &amp; say the situation wasn’t right
Now that was a #SuperBowl ad - makes me wanna go! #BringBackDundee https://t.co/xrPpSTixxK
#MGT358  RT @WARCData: $414m was spent on TV spots aired during Superbowl LII  – https://t.co/w2mIUhZBE1 https://t.co/tJ5nhj9O8t
@TheWeissLife Its 3 degrees today, absolutely baltic (as we would say here) little bit of snow this morning. Superbowl was so good on sunday. Any plans for today? X
#MGT358  RT @markritson: As usual the Super Bowl tells us much about the state of current advertising. https://t.co/l3YDlj00xv https://t.co/WDO0HLmCSJ
@Selwie @markritson No @Selwie, just a simple look at where I'm stationed (London) should have gotten you the info that I have **** all to do with Superbowl spend. A slightly deeper search would have found my forté is actually the digital space.
@NFL @gmfb They would have still lost . No ifs or buts they #Lost . #Eagles are #SuperBowl Champions .
I feel so left behind when it comes to Super Bowl memes I’d totally do 24-hrs research marathon and rewatch of all important games but I don’t have that much free time and my knowledge is so little...
The #Deadpool2 trailer is probably the best thing I've seen all day. It was better than all the trailers shown at the super bowl. Close tie with the MI:6 trailer.
Haven't seen it, but I know a couple of REALLY BIG Prince fans that thought it was a beautiful thing. One even was in tears. So maybe @HadleyFreeman has it wrong? 
https://t.co/L3BG8huXFv
@PatMcAfeeShow @NFoles_9 Gotta be 1 of the best super bowl calls ever 👏
@WhatKatySaid Super Bowl
@WhatKatySaid Might as well put "NFL vs 6 nation" as superbowl you no doubt will get alot higher audiences n etc as you get the bandwagoners just watch cause its the SuperBowl as bet most of these people won't watch the entire NFL season like most of us do
really good weekend for big blinny. highly suspect were fuckin awesome oh and killie were better
then won some dosh on the super bowl by backing a QB to TD who doesn't do that sort of thing and the eagles to win by 7 to 12 points
#classicstuff
After really enjoying the Super Bowl I'm going to give the NFL a serious attempt next season, no allegiance yet so gimme some help Twitter! Definitely not the Patriots or any team that plays in green

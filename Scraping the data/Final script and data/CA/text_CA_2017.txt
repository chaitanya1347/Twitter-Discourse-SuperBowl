I haven't had to do any mountain climbers this game .... #Superbowl #PatsGirl

So is this when the power goes out? #SuperBowl #Patriots #CheatToWin
Tom Brady sure is shit right now. #SuperBowl
It's hard to think of anything more overrated than Super Bowl commercials
I think New England will win the Super Bowl if they just let Frederick Douglas quarterback for once.

Watching the #Superbowl, my friend said they don't have to actually touch it down. Shouldn't it be called a "run-in" and not a "touchdown"?
21-0 for the Falcons tonight now, where's  those salty Pat Fans at?  #RiseUp  #SuperBowl #SuperBowlSunday
You just saw the difference between cam newton and tom Brady. Brady lays out for the ball and cam Shies away from it. #THEGOAT #SuperBowl
@AtlantaFalcons YEEEEEEEEEEES PICK 6 TOUCHDOWN!!!!! WOW I thought the #patroits were gonna score on that drive #RiseUp #SuperBowl
Awesome. https://t.co/7qoBx4jXX8
If the Pats can score here though.. still very much a tonne of football left. #Superbowl

The one time that being Canadian low key kinda sucks is Super Bowl time. I want the #Superbowl commercials 🙃 #SB51
¿¡COMO ASI QUE EL SUPER BOWL NO ES UN PARTIDO ENTRE UN EQUIPO QUE ARMA ADAM SANDLER CONTRA UNOS GUARDIAS DE PRISIÓN?!
A lot of disparity in the world these days, but Atlanta's unruly performance in the first half is something everyone can agree on #Superbowl
Ohhhhhh ! Mais quelle interception des Falcons ! Quel jeu ! 😮 #SuperBowl #SB51
Okaaay Atlanta I see you #SuperBowl
Wow! @AtlantaFalcons  are owning the @Patriots  in Superbowl LI #nfl

Melissa McCarthy owned the weekend between SNL and that Kia ad. #SuperBowl
LIVE AIR NOSE PIC ALERT #SuperBowl
@ladygaga THAT WAS INCREDIBLE!
Your sound, costumes, production, optics...
&amp; I loved that circle keyboard!
#gaga #ladygaga #superbowl https://t.co/r1nfBNIgAP
So the complete blow out has to harm the shine of the Pats right? + Trump? They are the Empire now right? #SuperBowl
@GlobalParker We love you but then there is superbowl!! Switching back &amp; forth! Lol!!!
So pretty much every superbowl add seems to be a fuck you to @realDonaldTrump
Lol patriots are painful to watch #SuperBowl
Might that be the dagger right there? I think so. Rise up Falcons fans!! #RiseUp #Super Bowl #Falcons #28-3
Condolences to the Patriots fans this game is done #SuperBowl #Falcons #Patriots
Real life @AtlantaFalcons fan: 'now that was funny.' @Kia ad. #SuperBowl
STRANGER THINGS 😍😍😍😍 #SuperBowl
oh your #SuperBowl parties sound cute, but do you honestly think they're more fun than organizing tupperware while listening to Little Mix?
Hey, the #Patriots are doing great tonight!  #alternativefact #SuperBowl #SuperBowlLI

I would highly recommend getting yourself invited to a super bowl party where someone makes bagel bites ........... from scratch.
I have officially stopped watching. Patriots looking at around the 4th worst loss in superbowl history atm 😭 there's always next year..
KIA Niro best SuperBowl commercial so far
Everyone talks about the #Falcons offense, but the defense has been almost impenetrable tonight. #SuperBowl

As a @MiamiDolphins fan, I must say this #SuperBowl has been fantastic. @CityofMiami
Soooo, let's just start the new 24 series now. #SuperBowl #NoNeedToWait ItsOver
KIA commercial,very funny. #SuperBowl
Do you think donald trump is going to sign an EO cancelling the fourth quarter and declaring the pats winners of the superbowl?
A few rewatches are in order. https://t.co/zV92laYqLU #SuperBowl https://t.co/g0nOrm3kkV
I'm not one for a blowout, especially in big games. But, I have all the time in the world for teams embarrassing the #Patriots. #SuperBowl
As a #dolphins fan this Super Bowl doesn't get any better unless Brady gets wiped out
more like Patrishits am I right #SuperBowl
#patriots D - could you please wake up?? I really don't care who wins but I want an exciting game. #SuperBowl
S'over. Book it. #RiseUp #SuperBowl #SB51 @IceCreamMan108 @DPernitsky

#Superbowl ATL all over it
Epic!! How @MattyHBF &amp; I watched @ladygaga during the #SuperBowl #Halftime !!!! #Gaga https://t.co/V5l04tfcJp
The footballs must be fully inflated tonight I guess. #Superbowl #SB51
Another home run for Atlanta! #SuperBowl
Brady looked like he gave up before halftime.  Looks like Falcons will take it in a walk! #SuperBowl
28-3 in the 3rd for Atlanta. I repeat, 28-3 in the 3rd for THE ATLANTA FALCONS OVER THE NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS IN THE SUPER BOWL #SB51
This game is getting not-exciting fast. The only saving grace? Trump *loves* the team getting trashed. #SuperBowl
The #patriots did know the game was today right? #Superbowl
I only watched the super bowl for Lady Gaga tbh 😂😂😂
According to@Audi, I am less valued. When spending $4M on an ad, one should consider verifying the factuality of the premise. #SuperBowl
Can u say sh&amp;t kicking #GoFalcons #SuperBowl
It's over! #Falcons #SuperBowl
Je vous l'avais dit Atlanta à une trop grande attaques c'est terminé #SuperBowl
DIRTY BUUUUURDS. #RiseUp #Falcons #SuperBowl #SBLI
- I'm kinda sad Gaga didn't do any songs from #ARTPOP but oh well, I'm still SHOOK! #SuperBowl
I need to start going for the falcons but I actually can't... so I'm just gonna be heated over here. #SuperBowl #GoPatriots
Shocking Super Bowl or The Most Shocking Super Bowl?
The cheating stops here #SuperBowl @AtlantaFalcons
Game over #patriots #SuperBowl
Touché et botté réussis. 28-3 #Falcons. #SuperBowl #NFL
So...is there a mercy rule in football? #SuperBowl #RiseUp
@kaylamarieTO so I guess you were right with the #Falcons #SuperBowl #SB51
Superbowl memes are lit
Wtf is happening? @Patriots #SuperBowl
Gaga at the #PepsiHalftime #Superbowl I predicted this https://t.co/vD8d9gvyNP
It's okay for falcons to fucking slam the patriots on the ground but not okay for a patriot to jump and block the ball...  #SuperBowl

I'm so glad I watched the Super Bowl... not really into football but wow! Lady Gaga and OT! What a game, congrats Pats 🏈
So as soon as #SuperBowl is over I have to watch #CTV on every f'n channel? What a crock.
With his 5th Super Bowl win &amp; his 4th MVP, surpassing the great Joe Montana on both categories, Tom Brady is arguably the greatest QB.
This is a pretty #SuperbOwl, you guys.. https://t.co/FRpVfBUZVX
Why u tweeting about the super bowl saying how great the patriats are. Like have u even watched a game this season??
Great thing about #SuperBowl is that the world came together to cheer two great teams instead of dwelling on politics. Thanks, we needed it.

@billburr is the only reason I'm okay with another #SuperBowl win for the #Patriots
There are many things wrong with the NFL, and that they present the championship trophy to the OWNER is a metaphor for several. #SuperBowl

Special timing for our #sportsbiz chat on @TattiAndMarsh on @TSN1150 today: 1 pm ET instead of 2 pm - breaking down #Superbowl TV audiences.
Still can't process @NHLBruins timing re media conference on firing of Claude Julien up against @Patriots #Superbowl parade. Real poor form.

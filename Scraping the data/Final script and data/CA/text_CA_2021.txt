2019 - 150 people were arrested as part of an FBI operation into sex trafficking in the lead-up to Super Bowl LIII.

34 individuals accused of trying to engage in sex acts with minors, 26 alleged cases of trafficking, nine reported adult victims and a further nine alleged youth.
2018 - 94 arrests were made over the Super Bowl during a sex trafficking sting operation.

Officers also recovered 28 potential victims, ages 17-49. Fourteen of the victims were from Minnesota, the other half were from out of state.

@GavinNewsom The Super Bowl will reverse this trend.
And this will take longer than it should be. I don't want to be locked down anymore than the next person but the numbers have to go down more. Cancel March break. Give it until the end of March. We need to see what happens after superbowl.

Involve men and boys in the conversation...talk to them about the harms of purchasing sex.

Sex trafficking is a national, regional and local issue that is highly profitable. It‚Äôs a highly profitable business with low risk for exploiters. #SuperBowl
According to an ASU study, ‚Äúthe research identified distinct victim movement and marketing trends that tend to correspond with the build up towards the Super Bowl‚Äù. #SuperBowl  @worldweyouth
According to the study, the volume of ads marketing commercial sex exceeded law enforcement capability to follow up, giving traffickers leeway. #SuperBowl  @worldweyouth

Somebody quick correct Viola Davis that Superbowl is not the world's largest sports stage. Maybe she was not heard of Soccer World Cup.
I also know with 100% certainty I will be asleep before the game is over #SuperBowl
The crappy thing about watching the #SuperBowl in Canada is that we don't get any of the good commercials.  Unless you consider commercials for The Good Doctor and Capital Direct good.
@fordnation Good luck with that. Super bowl Sunday &amp; Family Day coming up. 2-3 weeks later watch the #s climb...again!

So proud to see Amanda Gorman share her poetry at the Superbowl this evening!

SO proud that Spoken Word is making the waves that it is! üéâ
Once again watching the super bowl and hating the CRTC for allowing Bell to override American commercials.  I mute and watch the real commercial on YouTube. So annoying.
2 for 2 feeling like its gonna be a great night! #SuperBowl
I only have one thing to say before the #SuperBowl starts. Never bet against Tom Brady.
Go ads go!

There's something absolutely beautifully absurd about the #SuperBowl honoring an ICU nurse...yet having a stadium full of people.

Tuning in for #SuperBowl reminds me of a trip to Florida in grade 8. My Dad took a wrong turn in Orlando and we ended up on an interstate to Tampa Bay and we ended up driving right past the Buccaneers stadium. New stadium now but same location. #memories

I saw the only part of the Super Bowl I usually care about. Good show by The Weeknd. I like how he made use of the entire field, since fans weren‚Äôt allowed on it to watch the show this year. I forgot to watch Amanda Gorman, so I‚Äôll have to find that on YouTube.
That was basically my first live concert in almost a year. #TheWeeknd killed it.  üòç#SuperBowl
EPIC halftime #SuperBowl performance from @theweeknd. Proud of our Canadian music scene and for the 1st Canadian to headline a solo halftime show! #SuperBowlWeeknd #SuperBowlLV #sundayfunday #Starboy
Oh no. Our Canadian son. We‚Äôre so proud of him &amp; this performance. Just hoping the media can find some kindness for @theweeknd (a killer talent who had guts to perform this Covid year) #SuperBowl https://t.co/EWOqT9raAD

I had the incredible good fortune to be there.

Prince was the half time show.   I have yet to see another one come close!

The ultimate was him singing ‚ÄúPurple Rain‚Äù as it started to rain.

Super Bowl was different without the gathering we‚Äôre used to - food was definitely on point and thankfully, we don‚Äôt eat like that too often!

Super Bowl winner and aging: The head coach is 68 (oldest ever). The quarterback is 43. The tight end comes out of retirement at 31. And the winning team is from Florida. #SuperBowlWeeknd
Was off on the over/under. But totally right about the üêê. Never bet against the üêê! Amazing defensive performance by the Buccs. Big storyline is Patrick Mahomes never found the end zone. #TB12 is the undisputed GOAT. #SuperBowl

My Steelers Win 11 straight.
Steelers lose to division rival in worst loss in franchise history.
Brady leaves AFC, wins Superbowl with new team.

This defines the 2020 football season.

@Chiefs All I have to say is your luck of the season didn't just simply run out that night. You practically threw it all away.

Not a single touchdown? What's up with that?

6. Brady goat something special 
7. Gronk back

Ottawa public health is really leaning in on their super bowl error, right up to denying that Bruce even exists. I met him once: heck of a guy and deserves a second chance. https://t.co/Vp9CAaMcdt
@ComplexMusic @theweeknd @chartdata You made Canada proud at yesterday's superbowl.   You were clearly the highlight of the event.  My entire  family can't wait to see you live.
@eric_rahill the scariest demons live in side us. This must have been tough to share, I could see you tearing up a little. If it‚Äôs any constellation, we can celebrate Tom Brady winning the super bowl.
If Tom Brady is a #goatofgoats, with 7 SuperBowl Champs, he needs to have 5 more championships to beat the hockey legend's record, Henri Richard, with 11 Stanley Cup Champs.

As I was watching the Super Bowl I couldn‚Äôt help but thinking about my nephew Patrick Lee. Patrick got his Super Bowl ring in 2010 With his team the Green Bay Packers! So proud of you, Patrick, for putting in hard work and dedication; it paid off! https://t.co/pgwYyWb0tY

@ScooterMagruder On a side note.  The streaker from the Super Bowl.  He laid down $50k &amp; won $375k.  +750 prop bet.  There will be a streaker at the Super Bowl.   Cost him $1k to get out of the jail.
Absolutely brilliant.

The biggest sporting event of the year. The Super Bowl. Whether you're a fan of football or not, this time of year is, if just for a moment, when most of the world comes together.

@JJ_Calabrese Love Josh Allen... but the difference is a regular season MVP a Superbowl and Superbowl MVP when u do as much as Mahomes has in his young career u get a different type of treatment..I don't know why but it seems obviously.
I thought it was weird to have those cardboard cutouts in the seats at the Super Bowl, but dressing them for the Leafs in this game is even more questionable.
Leafs playing like they still hungover from Super Bowl party

@crslowey91 @jeffphowe @TomBrady The NFL Championship versus Super Bowl distinction is for idiots. The college football championship format has changed over the years but there‚Äôs no asterisk next to AP or BCS college titles. Fewer teams/players arguably means talent was less diluted. A title is a title, period.

People keep talking about #SRA and the #SuperBowl symbolism... I got news for ya. The only symbolism I would be worried about, is the music that we call ‚Äúentertaining‚Äù - pop culture degrading women and the pimp culture that these stars indoctrinate our youth with.
Did anyone else watch the Super Bowl and think of the Longest Yard? Did the players throw the game?
Anyone who blames KC loss in the Super Bowl on Patrick Mahomes please do us all a favour and never watch or comment on football again as you clearly have no idea what you're talking about.
